        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the following code for your Databricks connection">

    type: databricks
    details:
      host: string
      port: number
      path: string
      clientId: string
      token: string
      oauthClientId: string
      oauthClientSecret: string
    ```
    </Step>

## Attributes

- **Host** → The internet address of the Databricks cluster, specifying where the cluster is located online.
- **Port** → (Optional) The network port used for connecting to the Databricks cluster, indicating the communication entry point.
- **Path** → (Optional) Specifies the location of the workspace or resource on the Databricks host, detailing the specific access path.
- **ClientId** → (Optional) An identifier for the application connecting to Databricks, used for authentication purposes.
- **Token** → (Optional) A secret key used by the application to authenticate itself to Databricks.
- **OauthClientId** → (Optional) An identifier used for OAuth authentication, specifying the application in the OAuth process.
- **OauthClientSecret** → (Optional) A secret code used in conjunction with OauthClientId for OAuth authentication, verifying the application's identity.

## Test connection

To test the connection you can:

1. Create a query `.sql` in the `queries` directory that points to a table of your new connection in the `FROM` clause. See the section [SQL Syntax Basics](../queries/basics/sql-syntax-basics) to learn more.
2. Use the command line to run `latitude run query_file_name` where `query_file_name` is the name of your `.sql` file. This will display the results in your terminal. See the section [Running queries](../guides/development/latitude-cli#running-queries) to learn more about how to query your data.
