## How to configure sources

The sources files must be inside the `queries/` folder.

<Note>
  To know how the source hierarchy works, please, visit [How to configure
  sources](../sources/how-to-configure-sources).
</Note>

## Configuration

To configure the connection with your your Trino database follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the source `.yaml` file within the `queries` folder if you haven't already">
    ``` /queries/source.yml ```
  </Step>
  <Step title='Add the following code for your Trino connection'>
    ``` yaml 
    type: trino 
    details: 
      server: string
      catalog?: string
      schema?: string
      username: string
      password?: string
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title='Replace the details section with your info and save'></Step>
  <Step title='Done, now you can test your connection'></Step>
</Steps>

## Attributes

- **Server** → The unique identifier for your Trino account. This is a full url. Example: `http://localhost:8080`
- **Username** → The Trino username
- **Password** → (Optional) The user's  password
- **Catalog** → (Optional) The catalog
- **Schema** → (Optional) The db schema

## Test connection

To test the connection you can:

1. Create a query `.sql` in the `queries` directory that points to a table of your new connection in the `FROM` clause. See the section [SQL Syntax Basics](../queries/basics/sql-syntax-basics) to learn more.
2. Use the command line to run `latitude run query_file_name` where `query_file_name` is the name of your `.sql` file. This will display the results in your terminal. See the section [Running queries](../guides/development/latitude-cli#running-queries) to learn more about how to query your data.
