## How to configure sources

The sources files must be inside the `queries/` folder.

<Note>
  To know how it works the source hierarchy, please, visit [How to configure
  sources](../sources/how-to-configure-sources).
</Note>

## Configuration

To configure the connection with your your SQLite database follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title='Go to the source `.yaml` file within the `queries` folder'></Step>
  <Step title='Add the following code for your SQLite connection'>
    ``` yaml
    type: sqlite
    details: 
      url: string
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title='Replace the details section with your info and save'></Step>
  <Step title='Done, now you can test your connection'></Step>
</Steps>

## Attributes

- **URL** → The file path of the SQLite database on your system. SQLite is a file-based database, so instead of connecting to a server, you specify the path to the database file your application should use. This path can be absolute, pointing exactly where the file is located on the filesystem, or relative, based on the current working directory of your application.

## Test connection

To test the connection got to a file in `/queries/.../your_query_file.sql` and make a query using the new connection as source.

You can check the section [SQL Syntax Basics](../queries/basics/sql-syntax-basics) to know how to query your data.
