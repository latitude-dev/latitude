## How to configure sources

The sources files must be inside the `queries/` folder.

<Note>
  To know how the source hierarchy works, please, visit [How to configure
  sources](../sources/how-to-configure-sources).

## Configuration

To configure the connection with your your Athena database follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title='Go to the sources file in your Latitude project'>
    ``` /sources/sources.yaml ```
  </Step>
  <Step title='Add the following code for your Athena connection'>
    ``` yaml
    type: athena
    details:
      client: AthenaClientConfig
      database: string
      catalog: string
      workgroup: string
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title='Replace the details section with your info and save'></Step>

</Steps>

## Attributes

- **Client** → The identifier for the application or service making requests to Athena. This specifies the interface or tool you are using to interact with Athena.
- **Database** → The name of the Athena database where your queries will be executed. This is the container for your tables and data in Athena.
- **Catalog** → Identifies the data source catalog in Athena that organizes your databases and tables. It acts as a central repository for managing and accessing your diverse data sources.
- **Workgroup** → (Optional) A logical grouping of queries under a common configuration for cost tracking and resource management. It allows you to organize queries for optimization and governance purposes. If not specified, the default workgroup is used.

## Test connection

To test the connection got to a file in `/queries/.../your_query_file.sql` and make a query using the new connection as source.

You can check the section [SQL Syntax Basics](../queries/basics/sql-syntax-basics) to know how to query your data.
