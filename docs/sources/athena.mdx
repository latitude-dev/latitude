## Attributes

- **Client** → The identifier for the application or service making requests to Athena. This specifies the interface or tool you are using to interact with Athena.
- **Database** → The name of the Athena database where your queries will be executed. This is the container for your tables and data in Athena.
- **Catalog** →  Identifies the data source catalog in Athena that organizes your databases and tables. It acts as a central repository for managing and accessing your diverse data sources.
- **Workgroup** → (Optional) A logical grouping of queries under a common configuration for cost tracking and resource management. It allows you to organize queries for optimization and governance purposes. If not specified, the default workgroup is used.

## Test connection

To test the connection got to a file in `/queries/.../your_query_file.sql` and make a query using the new connection as source.

You can check the section [SQL Syntax Basics](../queries/basics/sql-syntax-basics) to know how to query your data.
