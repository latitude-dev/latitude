## How to configure sources

The sources files must be inside the `queries/` folder.

<Note>
  To know how the source hierarchy works, please, visit [How to configure
  sources](../sources/how-to-configure-sources).
</Note>

## Configuration

To configure the connection with your your Athena database follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the source `.yaml` file within the `queries` folder if you haven't already">
    ``` /queries/source.yml ```
  </Step>
  <Step title='Add the following code for your Athena connection'>
    ``` yaml
    type: athena
    details:
      client: AthenaClientConfig
      database: string
      catalog: string
      workgroup: string
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title='Replace the details section with your info and save'></Step>
  <Step title='Done, now you can test your connection'></Step>
</Steps>

## Attributes

- **Client** → The identifier for the application or service making requests to Athena. This specifies the interface or tool you are using to interact with Athena.
- **Database** → The name of the Athena database where your queries will be executed. This is the container for your tables and data in Athena.
- **Catalog** → Identifies the data source catalog in Athena that organizes your databases and tables. It acts as a central repository for managing and accessing your diverse data sources.
- **Workgroup** → (Optional) A logical grouping of queries under a common configuration for cost tracking and resource management. It allows you to organize queries for optimization and governance purposes. If not specified, the default workgroup is used.

## Test connection

To test the connection you can:

1. Create a query `.sql` in the `queries` directory that points to a table of your new connection in the `FROM` clause. See the section [SQL Syntax Basics](../queries/basics/sql-syntax-basics) to learn more.
2. Use the command line to run `latitude run query_file_name` where `query_file_name` is the name of your `.sql` file. This will display the results in your terminal. See the section [Running queries](../guides/development/latitude-cli#running-queries) to learn more about how to query your data.
