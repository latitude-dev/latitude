To configure the connection with your your Bigquery database follow these steps:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Go to the sources file in your Latitude project">
        ```
            /sources/sources.yaml
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the following code for your Bigquery connection">
      ``` yaml
      type: bigquery
          details:
            projectId: string
            credentials?: Partial<BigQueryOptions>
            token?: string

      ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Replace the details section with your info and save">
    </Step>
    <Step title="Done, now you can test your connection">
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Attributes

- **Project ID** → The unique identifier for your Google Cloud project. It's like the address for where all your BigQuery activities live, helping Google know which project your data and queries belong to.
- **Credentials** → (Optional) The keys or authentication details your application needs to prove it has permission to access your BigQuery data.
- **Token** → (Optional) A special security code your application uses to make secure requests to BigQuery.

## Test connection

To test the connection got to a file in `/queries/.../your_query_file.sql` and make a query using the new connection as source.

You can check the section [SQL Syntax Basics](../queries/basics/sql-syntax-basics) to know how to query your data.
