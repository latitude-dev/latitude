## How to configure sources

The sources files must be inside the `queries/` folder.

<Note>
  To know how the source hierarchy works, please, visit [How to configure
  sources](../sources/how-to-configure-sources).
</Note>

## Configuration

To configure the connection with your Bigquery database follow these steps:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create the source `.yaml` file within the `queries` folder if you haven't already">
      ``` /queries/source.yml ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the following code for your Bigquery connection">
      ``` yaml
      type: bigquery
      details:
        projectId: string
        token: string
        credentials: 
          client_email: string
          private_key: string
      ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Replace the details section with your info and save">
    </Step>
    <Step title="Done, now you can test your connection">
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Attributes

- **project_id** → The unique identifier for your Google Cloud project. It's like the address for where all your BigQuery activities live, helping Google know which project your data and queries belong to.
- **credentials** → (Optional) To connect via service account authentication
  - **clientEmail** -> Your service account email
  - **privateKey** -> Your service account private key
- **token** → (Optional) To connect with Oauth client ID authentication. This is Oauth's access token, which can be generated with gcloud's cli: `gcloud auth print-access-token`

For authentication, you'll either have to choose the `Credentials` or `Token` approach. In case both are defined, Credentials approach takes preference.

## Test connection

To test the connection you can:

1. Create a query `.sql` in the `queries` directory that points to a table of your new connection in the `FROM` clause. See the section [SQL Syntax Basics](../queries/basics/sql-syntax-basics) to learn more.
2. Use the command line to run `latitude run query_file_name` where `query_file_name` is the name of your `.sql` file. This will display the results in your terminal. See the section [Running queries](../guides/development/latitude-cli#running-queries) to learn more about how to query your data.
