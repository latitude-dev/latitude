## How to configure sources

The sources files must be inside the `queries/` folder.

<Note>
  To know how the source hierarchy works, please, visit [How to configure
  sources](../sources/how-to-configure-sources).

## Configuration

To configure the connection with your your Bigquery database follow these steps:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Go to the sources file in your Latitude project">
        ```
            /sources/sources.yaml
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the following code for your Bigquery connection">
      ``` yaml
      type: bigquery
      details:
        projectId: string
        credentials: Partial<BigQueryOptions>
        token: string
      ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Replace the details section with your info and save">
    </Step>
    <Step title="Done, now you can test your connection">
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Attributes

- **Project ID** → The unique identifier for your Google Cloud project. It's like the address for where all your BigQuery activities live, helping Google know which project your data and queries belong to.
- **Credentials** → (Optional) The keys or authentication details your application needs to prove it has permission to access your BigQuery data.
- **Token** → (Optional) A special security code your application uses to make secure requests to BigQuery.

## Test connection

To test the connection you can:

1. Create a query `.sql` in the `queries` directory that points to a table of your new connection in the `FROM` clause. See the section [SQL Syntax Basics](../queries/basics/sql-syntax-basics) to learn more.
2. Use the command line to run `latitude run query_file_name` where `query_file_name` is the name of your `.sql` file. This will display the results in your terminal. See the section [Running queries](../guides/development/latitude-cli#running-queries) to learn more about how to query your data.
