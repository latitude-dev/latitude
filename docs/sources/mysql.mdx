## How to configure sources

The sources files must be inside the `queries/` folder.

## Configuration

To configure the connection with your your MySQL database follow these steps:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Go to the sources file in your Latitude project">
        ```
            /sources/sources.yaml
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the following code for your MySQL connection">
      ``` yaml
      type: mysql
          details:
            host: string
            user: string
            password: string
            database: string
            ssl: {

## Attributes

- **Host** → The address of the server where your MySQL database lives. It could be a straightforward IP address like 192.168.1.1 or a domain name such as database.example.com. Think of it as the location where your database is hosted.
- **User** → The username you use to log into your MySQL database. It's like your personal key that identifies you to the MySQL server, allowing you access to perform operations within the database.
- **Password** → The password goes hand-in-hand with your username. It's the secret code that proves your identity to the MySQL server, ensuring that only authorized users can access the database.
- **Database** → The name of the specific MySQL database you want to get data from.

## Test connection

To test the connection got to a file in `/queries/.../your_query_file.sql` and make a query using the new connection as source.

You can check the section [SQL Syntax Basics](../queries/basics/sql-syntax-basics) to know how to query your data.
