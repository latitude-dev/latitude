## How to configure sources

The sources files must be inside the `queries/` folder.

<Note>
  To know how the source hierarchy works, please, visit [How to configure
  sources](../sources/how-to-configure-sources).
</Note>

## Configuration

To configure the connection with your your MySQL database follow these steps:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Create the source `.yaml` file within the `queries` folder if you haven't already">
      ``` /queries/source.yml ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add the following code for your MySQL connection">
      ``` yaml
      type: mysql
      details:
        host: string
        user: string
        password: string
        database: string
        ssl: boolean | 'Amazon RDS' | SSLConfig
      ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Replace the details section with your info and save">
    </Step>
    <Step title="Done, now you can test your connection">
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Attributes

- **Host** → The address of the server where your MySQL database lives. It could be a straightforward IP address like 192.168.1.1 or a domain name such as database.example.com. Think of it as the location where your database is hosted.
- **User** → The username you use to log into your MySQL database. It's like your personal key that identifies you to the MySQL server, allowing you access to perform operations within the database.
- **Password** → The password goes hand-in-hand with your username. It's the secret code that proves your identity to the MySQL server, ensuring that only authorized users can access the database.
- **Database** → The name of the specific MySQL database you want to get data from.
- **Ssl** -> (Optional) There are 3 options to configure SSL:
  - A `true` boolean for the default SSL strategy. This should work most of the times
  - An 'Amazon RDS' string to indicate a default profile included with the connector to connect to Amazon RDS instances
  - An SSLConfig object

### SslConfig

- **Ca** -> (Optional) Path to the CA certificate
- **Key** -> (Optional) Path to the SSL key
- **Cert** -> (Optional) Path to the SSL certificate
- **RejectUnauthorized** -> (Optional) True or false if the connector should validate the SSL certificate

## Test connection

To test the connection you can:

1. Create a query `.sql` in the `queries` directory that points to a table of your new connection in the `FROM` clause. See the section [SQL Syntax Basics](../queries/basics/sql-syntax-basics) to learn more.
2. Use the command line to run `latitude run query_file_name` where `query_file_name` is the name of your `.sql` file. This will display the results in your terminal. See the section [Running queries](../guides/development/latitude-cli#running-queries) to learn more about how to query your data.
