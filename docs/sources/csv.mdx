## How to configure sources

The sources files must be inside the `queries/` folder.

<Note>
  To know how the source hierarchy works, please, visit [How to configure
  sources](../sources/how-to-configure-sources).

## Configuration

To use CSV files directly within a Latitude project, we use the DuckDB adapter. Make sure to configure the connection through DuckDB by following these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the source `.yaml` file within the `queries` folder if you haven't already">
    ``` /queries/source.yml ```
  </Step>
  <Step title='Add the following code for your DuckDB connection'>
    ``` yaml
    type: duckdb
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title='Done, now you can test your connection'></Step>
</Steps>

## Add your files

Simply add your CSV files anywhere in the `queries` directory. You can also create subdirectories to organize your files.

## Test connection

To test the connection you can:

1. Create a query `.sql` in the `queries` directory that points to the CSV file in the `FROM` clause using the `read_csv_auto()` DuckDB function. Here's an example:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM read_csv_auto('queries/file.csv')
```
2. Use the command line to run `latitude run query_file_name` where `query_file_name` is the name of your `.sql` file. This will display the results in your terminal. See the section [Running queries](../guides/development/latitude-cli#running-queries) to learn more about how to query your data.
