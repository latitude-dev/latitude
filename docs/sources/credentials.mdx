## Introduction

You should never write secrets directly in code, instead provide them as runtime environment variables.

In order to accomplish this, declare a Latitude secret in the source details by
prefixing any value with `LATITUDE__`.

For example:

```yaml
type: postgres
details:
  password: LATITUDE__PASSWORD
  ...
```

At runtime, Latitude will check the environment for a LATITUDE\_\_PASSWORD env var and use it.

Read more on how to declare env vars – for both local development and production builds – in the [env vars section](/guides/development/environment-variables).

<Note>If you deploy with Latitude Cloud, you can store securely your secrets with [Latitude CLI secrets](/guides/deploy/latitude_cloud#secrets) command. Also available in our **FREE tier**</Note>
