## How to configure sources

The sources files must be inside the `queries/` folder.

<Note>
  To know how the source hierarchy works, please, visit [How to configure
  sources](../sources/how-to-configure-sources).
</Note>

## Configuration

To configure the connection with your your DuckDB database follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title='Go to the sources file in your Latitude project'>
    ``` /sources/sources.yaml ```
  </Step>
  <Step title='Add the following code for your DuckDB connection'>
    ``` yaml type: duckdb details: url: string ```
  </Step>
  <Step title='Replace the details section with your info and save'></Step>
  <Step title='Done, now you can test your connection'></Step>
</Steps>

## Attributes

- **URL** â†’ (Optional) This refers to the location of the DuckDB database file. DuckDB is an embedded database, so instead of connecting over a network, you specify the path to the database file on your local system or a shared filesystem. This path tells your application exactly where to find the DuckDB database you want to work with. In its absence, duckDB starts a new database in memory that will not get persisted once the connection is closed.

## Test connection

To test the connection you can:

1. Create a query `.sql` in the `queries` directory that points to a table of your new connection in the `FROM` clause. See the section [SQL Syntax Basics](../queries/basics/sql-syntax-basics) to learn more.
2. Use the command line to run `latitude run query_file_name` where `query_file_name` is the name of your `.sql` file. This will display the results in your terminal. See the section [Running queries](../guides/development/latitude-cli#running-queries) to learn more about how to query your data.
