## Attributes

- **URL** → This refers to the location of the DuckDB database file. DuckDB is an embedded database, so instead of connecting over a network, you specify the path to the database file on your local system or a shared filesystem. This path tells your application exactly where to find the DuckDB database you want to work with.

## Test connection

To test the connection got to a file in `/queries/.../your_query_file.sql` and make a query using the new connection as source.

You can check the section [SQL Syntax Basics](../queries/basics/sql-syntax-basics) to know how to query your data.
