## How to configure sources

The sources files must be inside the `queries/` folder.

<Note>
  To know how the source hierarchy works, please, visit [How to configure
  sources](../sources/how-to-configure-sources).
</Note>

## Configuration

To configure the connection with your your PostgreSQL database follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title='Go to the sources file in your Latitude project'>
    ``` /sources/sources.yaml ```
  </Step>
  <Step title='Add the following code for your PostgreSQL connection'>
    ``` yaml
    type: postgres
    details:
      database: string
      user: string
      password: string
      host: string
      port: number
      schema: string
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title='Replace the details section with your info and save'></Step>
  <Step title='Done, now you can test your connection'></Step>
</Steps>

## Attributes

- **User** → The user credentials to authenticate in your database.
- **Password** → The password to authenticate in your database.
- **Host** → The host for the database connection, which can be expressed as either an IP address like 127.0.0.1 or a domain like server.my.domain.org.
- **Database** → The exact name of the database that contains the data you want to sync.
- **Port** → The port number for the connection. In case you don’t have a port assigned the default port number of PostgreSQL is 5432.
- **Schema** → (Optional) The schema within the database that you want to connect to. A PostgreSQL database can contain multiple schemas, each of which can hold tables and other database objects. If not specified, the default schema (usually "public") is used

## Test connection

To test the connection you can:

1. Create a query `.sql` in the `queries` directory that points to a table of your new connection in the `FROM` clause. See the section [SQL Syntax Basics](../queries/basics/sql-syntax-basics) to learn more.
2. Use the command line to run `latitude run query_file_name` where `query_file_name` is the name of your `.sql` file. This will display the results in your terminal. See the section [Running queries](../guides/development/latitude-cli#running-queries) to learn more about how to query your data.
