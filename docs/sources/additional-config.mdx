In addition to each connector's details, there are some additional options that can be configured in any source. These options can either be set in the `config` object of the source schema
to set a default configuration for all the queries, or in each query itself using a special keyword.

## Example

```yaml
type: 'postgres'

details:
  #Â Connection details
  # ...

config:
  ttl: 3600 # 1 hour of lifetime
```

## Specific query configuration

You can also set a specific configuration for each query by adding a custom tag in the query itself. For more information, go to [Queries advanced configuration](/queries/advanced/config).
