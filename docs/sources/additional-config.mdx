In addition to each connector's details, there are some additional options that can be configured in any source. These options can either be set in the `config` object of the source schema
to set a default configuration for all the queries, or in each query itself using a special keyword.

## Example

```yaml
type: 'postgres'

details:
  # Connection details
  # ...

config:
  ttl: 3600 # 1 hour of lifetime
  materialize_query: false # Do not materialize the query (default)
```

## Specific query configuration

You can also set a specific configuration for each query by adding a custom tag in the query itself. For more information, go to [Queries advanced configuration](/queries/advanced/config).

## Available options

<Warning>Be careful setting `materialize_query: true` in all the source. It will materialize all the queries. Is better to set this setting at query level as explained in [queries documentation](/queries/advanced/config)</Warning>
