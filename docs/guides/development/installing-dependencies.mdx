## Introduction

You might want to extend the functionality of your Latitude projects by using
other npm packages.

Here's how you can do it:

<Steps>
  <Step title='Install dependencies'>
    You can install npm dependencies with a regular npm install command from the root of your project. Example:

    ```bash
    npm install --save lodash
    ```

    This will create a package.json file in your project root and add the
    dependency to it. The Latitude CLI will keep track of the dependencies you
    install and bundle them with your project.

  </Step>
  <Step title='Use your dependencies'>
    Latitude views are a superset of Svelte's template syntax. So you can use any JS dependency like you would in a [Svelte component](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-components). Following our example:
    ```svelte
      <script>
        import { isNan } from 'lodash'
      </script>

      {#if !isNan(1)}
        <p>Hello world</p>
      {/if}
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

Check out the [examples section](/guides/examples/templates) to see some use cases using third-party npm dependencies in Latitude projects.
