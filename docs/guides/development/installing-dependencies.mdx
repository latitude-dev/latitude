## Introduction

You might want to extend the functionality of your Latitude projects by using
other npm packages. 

Dependencies in Latitude can be installed like in any other npm project.

<Steps>
  <Step title='Initialize npm in your project'>
    Run the following command to create a blank package.json:

    ```npm init```

    The CLI will ask some questions, feel free to disregard all of them as they are not really important for our purposes.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Install dependencies'>
    You can now install any npm dependency with a regular npm install command. Example:

    ```npm install lodash```

    Latitude will keep any dependencies you install in sync with your project.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Use your dependencies'>
    Latitude views are a superset of Svelte's template syntax. So you can use any JS dependency like you would in a [Svelte component](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-components). Following our example:
    ```svelte
      <script>
        import { isNan } from 'lodash'
      </script>

      {#if !isNan(1)}
        <p>Hello world</p>
      {/if}
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

Check out the [examples section](/guides/examples/templates) to see some use cases using third-party npm dependencies in Latitude projects.
