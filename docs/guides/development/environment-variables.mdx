## Introduction

In order to declare env vars for local development add a `.env` file to the root of your project:

```bash
touch .env
```

Any env vars declared in this file will be accessible to your views. To learn more you 
can check the [Svelte documentation](https://learn.svelte.dev/tutorial/env-static-private).

## Environment variables in production

Although it is possible to declare envs vars in the .env file for the
production build, this is not a recommended practice. Instead declare env vars
at runtime. Here's how to do it for both the node and docker builds of a
Latitude project.

_NOTE: If a .env file is present at the root of a Latitude project during a
build step, we will include it in the final production build. This is to ensure
that the local production build works the same way the dev build does._

### Node build

For a regular production node build, declare env vars and secrets at runtime like so:

```bash
LATITUDE__PASSWORD=my_password node build
```

### Docker build

For a docker build, declare env vars and secrets at runtime like so:

```
docker run -e LATITUDE__PASSWORD=my_password <docker_image_id>
```

## Secrets

You can read more on source credentials in the [sources](/sources/credentials) section.
