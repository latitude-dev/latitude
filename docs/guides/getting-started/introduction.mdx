## What is Latitude?

Latitude is an open source framework to build interactive data apps on top of your database or data warehouse (or even static CSV files!) using code.

With Latitude, you can write composable SQL queries with custom parameters at runtime to pull and transform your data, and use our simple frontend components to display it.

The framework takes care of building the queries, running them on your data source, and returning them to the frontend, so you can focus on building the best possible data experience for your users.

## Quick start

Here's a quick getting started guide to get the sample app up and running:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Latitude CLI">
    Run the following command to install the Latitude CLI globally on your machine:
    ```bash
    npm install -g @latitude-data/cli
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the starter project">
    Run this command to create a new empty Latitude project:
    ```bash
    latitude start
    ```
    The CLI will ask you the project name. Once you're done, you'll have a new directory with an empty Latitude project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to the project and run the app">
    ```bash
    cd my-new-app
    latitude dev
    ```
    This will start the development server and open the starter app in your browser.
  </Step>
</Steps>

From here, you can start customizing the app to fit your needs. You can add queries, build the frontend, and deploy the app to share it with others.

Check out the rest of the documentation to learn more about the Latitude framework and how to build your own data apps.
