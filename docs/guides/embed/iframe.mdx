## Introduction

You can embed a Latitude data app in an iframe on your website or in a web application. This allows you to display the app in a specific location on your website and it's the most straightforward way to embed a Latitude data app.

## Embedding

To embed a Latitude data app in an iframe, you need to use the following HTML code:

```html
<iframe src="https://url-to-your-app.latitude.so/" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```

Replace `https://url-to-your-app.latitude.so/` with the public URL where your Latitude data app is deployed. You can also adjust the `width` and `height` attributes to fit your website's layout.

## Passing parameters

You can pass parameters to the Latitude data app using the URL query string. For example, to pass a `country` parameter with the value `US`, you can use the following URL:

```html
<iframe src="https://url-to-your-app.latitude.so/?country=US" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```

This will pass the `country` parameter with the value `US` to the underlying queries in the data app.

Passing parameters is useful when you want to filter the data displayed in the app based on the context of the page where the app is embedded, for example you can scope the data to a specific user by passing a `user_token` parameter (or any other parameter that makes sense for your use case).

## Passing signed parameters
If you want to pass sensitive information to a Latitude data app, you can use signed parameters. This allows you to pass parameters that are encrypted and signed by your server, so that they can't be tampered with by the user.
The signed parameter has to be called `__token`
```html
<iframe src="https://url-to-your-app.latitude.so/?__token=[SECRET_TOKEN]
```
To learn more about how to generate a `[SECRET_TOKEN]` please refer to the [signed parameters](/queries/logic/parameters#signed-parameters) documentation.
