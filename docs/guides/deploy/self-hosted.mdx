## Build for production

To build the production version of your data app run the following command:

```bash
latitude build
```

Once done, access it with:

```bash
cd build
```

And run it with:

```bash
node build
```

## Docker container

You will need the [Docker CLI](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed in your machine.

Every Latitude project comes with a Dockerfile to streamline containerization. Use the command below to build a Docker container with your data app's production version:

```bash
latitude build --docker
```

Under the hood this command is preparing the data app for a production build and forwarding the build command to the docker CLI. If you want fine-grained control over
the docker container build process you can directly call the `docker build` process with a previous `latitude prepare` step:

```bash
$ latitude prepare
$ docker build .
```

See the [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/image/build/) documentation for more details.
