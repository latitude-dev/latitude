The production version of your Latitude project can be built either as a
standard NodeJS application or within a Docker container. We recommend the
Docker approach, as it simplifies the deployment process later on.

## Docker container

<Note>
  You will need the [Docker CLI](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed in your machine.
</Note>

Every Latitude project is equipped with a Dockerfile to facilitate
containerization. To build the Docker container for your Latitude project,
proceed as you would with any other Docker project:

```bash
docker build . -t my-latitude-app
```
Once the build is complete, you can test your app locally with:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-latitude-app
```

See the [docker build](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/image/build/) documentation for more details.

## NodeJS production build

To build the NodeJS production version of Latitude projet app, run the following command:

```bash
latitude build
```

This command will build your app in a `build` directory at the root of your project. Once completed, access the build folder:

```bash
cd build
```

And run your app:

```bash
node build
```
