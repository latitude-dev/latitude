## Introduction

The framework automatically creates an API for you based on the queries you have defined in your project. This means that you can easily expose your data to any other app or service.

In this tutorial, we will learn to:

1. [Create a new data app](#1-create-a-new-data-app)
2. [Add a data source](#2-add-a-data-source)
3. [Write your queries](#3-write-your-queries)
4. [Accessing the API endpoints](#4-accessing-the-api-endpoints)
5. [Next steps](#5-next-steps)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you followed the [installation guide](/guides/getting-started/installation) to install Latitude.

## 1. Create a new data app

To create a new data app, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
latitude start
```

After the app is created, navigate to the app's directory and start the development server by running the following commands:

```bash
cd my-app
latitude dev
```

This will start the development server and open your app in your default browser. Since we're not interested in building a UI for this guide, you can close the browser tab and delete the `views` directory from your project.

## 2. Add a data source

To add a data source to your app, you'll need to create a new file in the `sources` directory.

For this guide, we'll use the CSV that comes with the sample project, but you can replace that with any other CSV or connect to a live database following [these instructions](/sources).

Go ahead and download the [sample CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/latitude-dev/sample-netflix/main/queries/netflix.csv) and save it in the `queries` directory as `source.csv`.

  Visit the page and hit `Cmd + S` or `Ctrl + S` to save the file

## 3. Write your queries

Now that you have a data source, you can write your first query. Create a new file named `sample.sql` in the `queries` directory and write the following query:

```sql sample.sql
select *
from read_csv_auto('queries/source.csv')
```

This query will select all the rows from the `source.csv` file using our default DuckDB adapter (you don't need to configure anything else to get this working).

Next, let's create a secondary query to aggregate some data. Create a new file named `sample_agg.sql` in the `queries` directory and write the following query:

```sql sample_agg.sql
select
  release_year,
  count(*) AS total_titles,
from { ref('sample') }
group by 1
order by 1 asc
```

This query will count the number of titles released each year. The `ref` function is used to interpolate the `sample.sql` query, and use its results as the input for this query. Latitude allows you to chain queries together very easily, find out more about this in the [queries reference](/queries).

To check that your queries are working as expected, you can run them locally using the `latitude run` command. For example:

```bash
latitude run sample_agg
```

This will run the `/queries/sample_agg.sql` query once and display the results in your terminal.

Learn more about `latitude run` in the [CLI reference](/guides/development/latitude-cli#running-queries).

## 4. Accessing the API endpoints

Now that you have your queries set up, you can access the API endpoints. The Latitude automatically creates an API for you based on the file structure you have defined in your project.

To access the API, you can use any HTTP client, such as `curl`, Postman, or even your browser. For example, to access the `/api/queries/sample_agg` endpoint, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/queries/sample_agg
```

This will return the results of the `sample_agg.sql` query in JSON format.

### 4.1 Passing parameters to your queries

You can also pass parameters to your queries by adding them to the URL. Let's edit our `sample_agg.sql` file to support a `year` parameter. Replace the contents of the file with the following and save it:

```plaintext sample_agg.sql
select
  release_year,
  count(*) as total_titles,
from { ref('sample') }
{#if param('year')}
    where release_year = {param('year')}
{/if}
group by 1
order by 1 asc
```

Now, you can pass the `year` parameter to the `/api/queries/sample_agg` endpoint. For example, to get the results for the year 2020, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/queries/sample_agg?year=2020
```

This will return the results of the `sample_agg.sql` query for the year 2020 in JSON format.

## 5. Next steps

Congratulations! You have successfully created an API to your data with the Latitude. You can now use this API to access your data from any other app or service.
