## Introduction

This guide will walk you through creating a simple data app using Latitude. You'll learn how to:

1. [Create a new data app](#1-create-a-new-data-app)
2. [Add a data source](#2-add-a-data-source)
3. [Write your queries](#3-write-your-queries)
4. [Define the layout and visualizations](#4-define-the-layout-and-visualizations)
5. [Next steps](#5-next-steps)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you followed the [installation guide](/guides/getting-started/installation) to install Latitude.

## 1. Create a new data app

To create a new data app, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
latitude start
```

Type in the name of your app and press enter. This will create a new directory with the name of your app and a basic structure for it.

After the app is created, navigate to the app's directory and start the development server by running the following commands:

```bash
cd my-app
latitude dev
```

This will start the development server and open your app in your default browser.

## 2. Add a data source

To add a data source to your app, you'll need to create a new file in the `sources` directory.

For this guide, we'll use the CSV that comes with the sample project, but you can replace that with any other CSV or connect to a live database following [these instructions](/sources).

Go ahead and download the [sample CSV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/latitude-dev/sample-netflix/main/queries/netflix.csv) and save it in the `queries` directory as `source.csv`.

<Card title="Download sample CSV" icon="link" iconType="duotone" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/latitude-dev/sample-netflix/main/queries/netflix.csv">
  Visit the page and hit `Cmd + S` or `Ctrl + S` to save the file

## 3. Write your queries

Now that you have a data source, you can write your first query. Create a new file named `sample.sql` in the `queries` directory and write the following query:

```sql sample.sql
select id,
       title,
       release_year,
       type,
       runtime,
       imdb_score
from read_csv_auto('queries/source.csv')
order by release_year asc
```

This query will select all the rows from the `source.csv` file using the DuckDB adapter that's configured by default in the `source.yml` file.

Next, let's create a secondary query to aggregate some data. Create a new file named `sample_agg.sql` in the `queries` directory and write the following query:

```sql sample_agg.sql
select
  release_year,
  count(*) as total_titles,
from { ref('sample') }
group by 1
order by 1 asc
```

This query will count the number of titles released each year. The `ref` function is used to interpolate the `sample.sql` query, and use its results as the input for this query. Latitude allows you to chain queries together very easily, find out more about this in the [queries reference](/queries/advanced/reference-queries).

To check that your queries are working as expected, you can run them locally using the `latitude run` command. For example:

```bash
latitude run sample_agg
```

This will run the `/queries/sample_agg.sql` query once and display the results in your terminal.

Learn more about `latitude run` in the [CLI reference](/guides/development/latitude-cli#running-queries).

## 4. Define the layout and visualizations

Now that you have your queries, you can define the layout and visualizations for your app.

Open the `index.html` file in your text editor and replace the content with the following:

```html index.html
<View class="gap-8 p-8">
  <Row>
    <Text.H2 class="font-bold">Netflix titles released over time</Text.H2>
  </Row>
  <Row>
    <LineChart
      query="sample-agg"
      x="release_year"
      y="total_titles"
    />
  </Row>
  <Row>
    <Table query="sample" />
  </Row>
</View>
```

Open your browser and navigate to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) and you should see a working data app with a line chart displaying the number of titles released over time and a table with the raw data.

## 5. Next steps

You've successfully created a simple data app using Latitude. You've learned how to create a new app, add a data source, write queries, and define the layout and visualizations. You can now build on this knowledge to create more complex data apps and explore the full capabilities of Latitude.
