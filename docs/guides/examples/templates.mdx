## Introduction

Here's a list of curated templates for Latitude projects that showcase some typical use cases. More will be added in the future.

Here's the list:

- [Netflix template](https://github.com/latitude-dev/sample-netflix) - Contains some data, queries and a fairly complex view to showcase the main features of Latitude
- [Flyio template](https://github.com/latitude-dev/sample-netflix-flyio) - Contains configuration and documentation on how to deploy a Latitude production build to Fly.io
