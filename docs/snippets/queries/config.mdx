<ParamField path="ttl" type="number">
  The number of seconds that the data will be cached in the Latitude cache. If the data is older than the TTL, Latitude will fetch the data again from the source.
  If not set, the default TTL is infinite, so the only way to refresh the data is by actually sending a fetch request with the `force` flag. [More information.](/queries/basics/cache)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path='materialize_query' type='boolean'>
  Set this value to `true` to materialize the query. [More information.](/queries/advanced/materialized-queries)
</ParamField>
