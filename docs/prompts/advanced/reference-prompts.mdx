## Introduction

The Reference Prompts feature allows you to include code from another file in your current prompt. This is useful for reusing common parts of a prompt, ensuring that your instructions are consistent and easy to maintain.

## How It Works

To reference code from another prompt, use the syntax `{ref ('other_prompt')}`, where `other_prompt` is the name of another `.prompt` file located in the `/prompts` folder. This syntax compiles the specified prompt and imports the instructions to the location where it is added.

### Referencing prompts as a source

An important use case for referencing other prompts is creating specific instructions for multiple prompts. You can do this as follows:

```jsx prompts/data/data_engineer_description.prompt
You are a data engineer, an expert on data analysis and visualization.
```

```jsx prompts/data/analysis.prompt
{ref('./data_engineer_description')}

Describe the results of the following table:
{table(runQuery('data'))}
```

Which will translate to:

```md prompts/data/analysis.prompt
You are a data engineer, an expert on data analysis and visualization.

Describe the results of the following table:

| id | name | age | city |
|----|------|-----|------|
| 1  | John | 25  | New York |
| 2  | Jane | 30  | Los Angeles |
| 3  | Bob  | 35  | Chicago |
```
