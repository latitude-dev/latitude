## Introduction
In some cases, we want to generate prompts based on some dynamic input. This allows for more flexibility in the responses we generate and how we display them.

This can be done with the help of parameters, which are passed to the prompt when it is executed.

## Parameters
The parameters are values that are passed to the prompt when it is executed, either through [View components](/views/basics/running-prompts#parameters), [API requests](/guides/examples/api#4-1-passing-parameters-to-your-prompts), or [using the CLI](/guides/development/latitude-cli#passing-parameters). To know more information about how parameters are used in each case, please refer to their own documentation.

In the prompt, the parameters can be used with the `param()` function. This function retrieves the value specified by the user and inserts it safely into the prompt.

```jsx
{param('greeting')}, how can I assist you today?
```

### Fallback

If the required parameter is not found in the request, the prompt will fail. To avoid this, you can set a fallback value in the `param()` function.

```jsx
{param('greeting', 'Hello')}, how can I assist you today?
/* If no greeting is found, it will use 'Hello' as the value */
```

### Check if a parameter is present

Requesting a parameter that is not present will result in an error. To avoid this, you can check if the parameter is present using a [conditional statement](/prompts/logic/if-else) and `false` as the fallback value.

```jsx
{#if param('user_id', false)}
  /* The parameter is present in the request */
  Welcome back, user {param('user_id')}!
{/if}
```
