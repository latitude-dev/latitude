## Introduction

The logic blocks supports conditional execution through the use of if and else, allowing dynamic prompt indications to be executed only when certain conditions are met.

## Syntax

The syntax of these conditions is as follows:

### Simple Conditions
Includes the code only if the condition is true, without an alternative.

```jsx
{#if param('use_detailed_answer')}
    Please provide a detailed answer, including all the steps and explanations.
{/if}
```

### Conditions with Else
Allow two content alternatives. If the condition is not true, the content defined after `{:else}` will be included.
   
```jsx
{#if param('use_detailed_answer')}
    Please provide a detailed answer, including all the steps and explanations.
{:else}
    Please provide a concise answer, without getting into the details.
{/if}
```

### Multiple Conditions
Allow unlimited content alternatives. It evaluates conditions cascading until one is met. If none is met, it returns the content defined after `{:else}`.

```jsx
{#if param('answer_type') == 'detailed'}
    Please provide a detailed answer, including all the steps and explanations.
{:else if param('answer_type') == 'steps'}
    Provide your answer as a list of simple steps.
{:else if param('answer_type') == 'concise'}
    Please provide a concise explanation about your answer, without getting into the details.
{:else}
    Just provide a brief answer, without any explanations.
{/if}
```

## Expressions

Expressions are crucial for determining the logic within if and else constructs. They can evaluate variables, constants, or any combination of the two using a variety of operators.

### Values

Values can be inside expressions:

- **Prompt parameters**: Values passed to the request. For example, `param('response_type')` could be a query parameter representing how the user wants the response to look like. Check out [Prompt Parameters](/prompts/logic/parameters) for more information.
    ```jsx
    {#if param('response_type') == 'detailed'}
    ```
- **Variables/Parameters**: Variables can be defined in the prompt itself to be used in expressions. For example, `id` could be a variable representing a user's ID. Check out [Variables](/prompts/logic/variables) for more information.
    ```jsx
    {id = param('user_id')}
    {max_id = 100}

    {#if id > max_id} 
      /* Your custom prompt here */
    {/if}
    ```

### Operations

Complex operations can be performed within expressions:

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Basic arithmetic operations can be performed within expressions.
    ```jsx
    {#if param('limit') * 2 > 100}
    ```

- **String Operations**: String operations can be performed within expressions.
    ```jsx
    {#if param('username').length > 5}
    {#if param('username').startsWith('vip-')}
    ```

### Comparisons

Expressions are compared with operators, which include the following options:

- **Equality and Inequality**:
  - `==`: Equal to
    ```jsx
    {#if id == 100}
    ```
  - `!=`: Not equal to
    ```jsx
    {#if id != 100}
    ```
- **Greater Than or Less Than**:
  - `>`: Greater than
    ```jsx
    {#if id > 100}
    ```
  - `<`: Less than
    ```jsx
    {#if id < 100}
    ```
  - `<=`: Less than or equal to
    ```jsx
    {#if id <= 100}
    ```
  - `>=`: Greater than or equal to
    ```jsx
    {#if id >= 100}
    ```
- **Multiple conditions**:
  - `&&`: Logical AND to concatenate multiple conditions in the same expression. **They must all be true to continue**.
    ```jsx
    {#if id > 100 && workspace_id = 45}
    ```
  - `||`: Logical OR to concatenate multiple conditions in the same expression. **At least one of them must be true to continue**.
    ```jsx
    {#if id > 100 || workspace_id = 45}
    ```
