## Introduction

Variables and constants store values you can later use anywhere in your prompt.

## Basic Usage
Variables are placeholders that can be assigned and reassigned values throughout the prompt.

To assign a value to a variable, use the equal sign `=` followed by the value.
```jsx
{name = 'foo'}
{age = 30}
{sum = 2 + 4} 
```

For example, take a look at the following prompt definition and what will actually be generated:
<CodeGroup>
```jsx Your Prompt
/* Defining the variable and prompt */
{sum = 2 + 4} 

Generate a list of {sum} names.
```

```md Compiled Prompt
Generate a list of 6 names.
```
</CodeGroup>

### Incrementing
Variables can be modified using operations such as addition.

<CodeGroup>
```jsx Your Prompt
{counter = 10} /* Define the variable */

List the following values:
{#each [1, 2, 3] as item, index}
  Value {counter}

  /* Add a comma at the end to every element except the last one */
  {#if index + 1 < item.length}
    ,
  {/if}

  /* Increment the value of the variable */             
  {counter = counter + 10}
{/each}
```
```md Compiled Prompt
Please list the following values:
Value 10, Value 20, Value 30
```
</CodeGroup>

## Constants
Constants are similar to variables but, once defined, their value cannot be changed. Also, the main syntax difference is constants are defined using the `@const` keyword.

```jsx
{@const greeting = 'Hello.'}
```

<CodeGroup>
```jsx Your Prompt
{@const greeting = 'Hello.'} /* Defined a constant */

{#if param('tone') == 'informal'}
    {greeting = 'Hi!'} /* Attempting to reassign the constant */
{/if}
```
```md Compiled Prompt
'!Error: Cannot reassign a constant'
```
</CodeGroup>

## Scope
### Global
Variables defined outside of any logic blocks are considered global and can be modified and accessed throughout the entire code.
```jsx
{greeting = 'Hello.'}
```

Variables can be accessed and modified anywhere in the code.
<CodeGroup>
```jsx Your Prompt
{greeting = 'Hello.'} /* Define the variable */

{greeting} It is a beautiful day.

{greeting = 'Hi!'} /* Reassign the variable */

{greeting} How are you doing?
```
```md Compiled Prompt
Hello. It is a beautiful day.
Hi! How are you doing?
```
</CodeGroup>

### Local Variables
Variables defined within logic blocks are local to that block. They cannot be accessed outside the block in which they are defined.

```jsx
{greeting = 'Hello.'}
{#if condition}
    {goodbye = 'Goodbye.'} /* Accessible only within this block */
{/if}
```
