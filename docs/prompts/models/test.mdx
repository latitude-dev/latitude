The Test model is a simple model that can be used for debugging purposes. It will always return the contents from the prompt, instead of actually generating a response.

Just add "test" as the model type in your `.yaml` file:

```yaml prompts/test/source.yaml
type: test
```

## Propmts

Creating a propmt with simple text will just return the same text as the response.

Additionally, you can use custom commands to make the model behave differently. To do so, create a new line in your prompt with the following format:

 - `FAIL <message>`: Will always fail with the specified message.
 - `SLEEP <milliseconds>`: Will wait for the specified number of milliseconds before contining generating the response.
