## Details

In order to use Latitude with OpenAI, you will need the following information:

<ParamField path='apiKey' type='string'>
  Your OpenAI API key. You can find it in your [OpenAI dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
</ParamField>

```yaml prompts/openai/source.yaml
type: openai
details:
  apiKey: sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

<Note>
  Instead of using your API key directly, we recommend using environment variables to store your secrets. Read more about [environment variables](/guides/development/environment-variables) to learn how to do this.
