## Introduction

For each of your prompts, Latitude automatially generates a REST API at `/api/prompt/<prompt-name>`.

Accessing to this endpoint will return as a plain text the response of your prompt.

## Parameters

In your prompt, you can use dynamic parameters, like it is explained in the [Parameters Section](/prompts/logic/parameters). To pass these parameters to your API, you can simply add them as query parameters in the URL.

For example, if you have a prompt named `joke` with the following content:

```prompt
Tell me a joke about { param('topic') }
```

You can access to this prompt at `/api/prompt/joke?topic=cats` and it will return a joke about cats.

## Streaming

If you want to stream the response of your prompt instead of waiting for it to be generated, you can add the internal `__stream` parameter to your URL and set it to `true`. This will make Latitude return a [SSE stream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) instead of a plain text response.

For example, if you have a prompt named `joke` with the following content:

```prompt
Tell me a joke about { param('topic') }
```

You can access to this prompt at `/api/prompt/joke?topic=cats&__stream=true` and it will return a SSE stream of the response of your prompt.
