## Introduction
The Funnel chart visualizes sequential stages in a process, showing decreasing quantities through segments. It's key for tracking conversion rates, identifying potential bottlenecks, and optimizing process flows.

## Preparation
The query `.sql` file that the Funnel chart accepts must contain only 2 columns, one for the labels and another one for the values.

| labels      | values   |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Pending     | 245      |
| In Progress | 120      |
| Closed      | 32       |


## Syntax
You can use `<FunnelChart ... />` to add it to your view. Within the tag you must add the properties to configure the chart.

``` js
<FunnelChart
	query='orders_evolution'
    config={{ 
        sort: descending,
        showColorGradient: false,
        showLabels: true
    }}
/>
```

## Properties
To configure and customize the chart, you can add properties, some of which are required and some of which are optional.

<ParamField path="query" type="string" required>
    The name of your `.sql` file from which your chart will get the data. It's not necessary to specify the full path, just the name, because we will search all folders until we find it
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="config" type="array">
    Contains some options to customize your chart.
    
    [See the Config section](#config) to learn more about the options.
