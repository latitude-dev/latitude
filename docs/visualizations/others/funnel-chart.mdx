## Introduction
The Funnel chart visualizes sequential stages in a process, showing decreasing quantities through segments. It's key for tracking conversion rates, identifying potential bottlenecks, and optimizing process flows.

## Preparation
The query `.sql` file that the Funnel chart accepts must contain only 2 columns, one for the labels and another one for the values.

| labels      | values   |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Pending     | 245      |
| In Progress | 120      |
| Closed      | 32       |


## Syntax
You can use `<FunnelChart ... />` to add it to your view. Within the tag you must add the properties to configure the chart.

``` js
<FunnelChart
	query='orders_evolution'
    config={{ 
        sort: descending,
        showColorGradient: false,
        showLabels: true
    }}
/>
```

## Properties
To configure and customize the chart, you can add properties, some of which are required and some of which are optional.

<ParamField path="query" type="string" required>
    The name of your `.sql` file from which your chart will get the data. It's not necessary to specify the full path, just the name, because we will search all folders until we find it
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="config" type="array">
    Contains some options to customize your chart.
    
    [See the Config section](#config) to learn more about the options.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="opts" type="array">
    Includes options to control the behavior of the chart. For example, react to changes in the parameters to update the data immediately.
    
    [See the Reactive To Params section](#reactive-to-params) to learn more about it.
</ParamField>

### Config

<ParamField path="showColorGradient" type="boolean">
    Whether the color of each layer is a gradient or whether each layer is a different color.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="animation" type="boolean">
    Specifies whether or not to show an animation when the page loads.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="showLabels" type="boolean">
    Display the category name directly on the chart.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="showLegend" type="boolean">
    Display the color legend for each series displayed.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="showDecal" type="boolean">
    Add a visual pattern to each series to help colorblind people distinguish them.
</ParamField>

### Reactive To Params

Within the `opts` property we can include some options to modify the behavior of the chart. At the moment only the `reactiveToParams` option is available.

<ParamField path="reactiveToParams" type="boolean">
    If true, the chart will react to any change in the params to update the data displayed without the need to run the view manually.
</ParamField>

```js
<FunnelChart
	query='orders_evolution'
    opts={{
        reactiveToParams: true
    }}
/>
```
