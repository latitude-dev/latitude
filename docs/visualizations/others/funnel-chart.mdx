## Introduction
The Funnel chart visualizes sequential stages in a process, showing decreasing quantities through segments. It's key for tracking conversion rates, identifying potential bottlenecks, and optimizing process flows.

## Preparation
The query `.sql` file that the Funnel chart accepts must contain only 2 columns, one for the labels and another one for the values.

| values   | labels      |
| -------- | ----------- |
| 245      | Pending     |
| 120      | In Progress |
| 32       | Closed      |

## Syntax
You can use `<FunnelChart ... />` to add it to your view. Within the tag you must add the properties to configure the chart.

``` js
<FunnelChart
	query='orders_evolution'
  sort='descending'
  showColorGradient={false}
  showLabels={true}
/>
```

## Properties
To configure and customize the chart, you can add properties, some of which are required and some of which are optional.

<ParamField path="query" type="string" required>
    The name of your `.sql` file from which your chart will get the data. It's not necessary to specify the full path, just the name, because we will search all folders until we find it
