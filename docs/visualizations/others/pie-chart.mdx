## Introduction
A pie chart visualizes data as proportional segments of a circle. It makes easier to see relative sizes of categories at a glance, ideal for highlighting distribution and composition.

## Preparation
The query `.sql` file that the Pie Chart accepts must contain only 2 columns, one for the labels and another one for the values.


| labels    | values   |
| --------- | -------- |
| Drinks    | 145      |
| Snacks    | 539      |
| Fruits    | 987      |


## Syntax
You can use `<PieChart ... />` to add it to your view. Within the tag you must add the properties to configure the chart.

``` js
<PieChart
    query='titles-type'
    x='type'
    y='count'
    title='Titles by type'
    config={{
        showHole: true
    }}
/>
```

## Properties
To configure and customize the chart, you can add properties, some of which are required and some of which are optional.

<ParamField path="query" type="string" required>
    The name of your `.sql` file from which your chart will get the data. It's not necessary to specify the full path, just the name, because we will search all folders until we find it
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="config" type="array">
    Contains some options to customize your chart.
    
    [See the Config section](#config) to learn more about the options.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="opts" type="array">
    Includes options to control the behavior of the chart. For example, react to changes in the parameters to update the data immediately.
    
    [See the Reactive To Params section](#reactive-to-params) to learn more about it.
</ParamField>

### Config

<ParamField path="showLabels" type="boolean">
    Display the category name directly on the chart.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="showHole" type="boolean">
    Display a circular space withing the pie allowing to show the total sum of the values.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="showTotalValue" type="boolean">
    When the `showHole` property is true allow to show the total sum of the values.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="showLegend" type="boolean">
    Display the color legend for each series displayed.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="showDecal" type="boolean">
    Add a visual pattern to each series to help colorblind people distinguish them.
</ParamField>

### Reactive To Params

Within the `opts` property we can include some options to modify the behavior of the chart. At the moment only the `reactiveToParams` option is available.

<ParamField path="reactiveToParams" type="boolean">
    If true, the chart will react to any change in the params to update the data displayed without the need to run the view manually.
</ParamField>

```js
<PieChart
    query='titles-type'
    x='type'
    y='count'
    title='Titles by type'
    opts={{
        reactiveToParams: true
    }}
/>
```
