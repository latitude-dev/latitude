## Introduction
The Table format organizes data in rows and columns, providing a clear view for comparison and detailed analysis. It's ideal for displaying precise values.

## Syntax
You can use `<Table ... />` to add it to your view. Within the tag you must add the properties to configure the chart.

``` js
<Table
	query='orders_evolution'
/>
```

## Properties
To configure and customize the table, simply reference the query from which you want to view the data.

<ParamField path="query" type="string" required>
    The name of your `.sql` file from which your chart will get the data. It's not necessary to specify the full path, just the name, because we will search all folders until we find it
</ParamField>
