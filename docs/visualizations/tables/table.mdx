## Introduction
The Table format organizes data in rows and columns, providing a clear view for comparison and detailed analysis. It's ideal for displaying precise values.

## Syntax
You can use `<Table ... />` to add it to your view. Within the tag you must add the properties to configure the chart.

``` js
<Table
	query='orders_evolution'
/>
```

## Properties
To configure and customize the table, simply reference the query from which you want to view the data.

<ParamField path="query" type="string" required>
    The name of your `.sql` file from which your chart will get the data. It's not necessary to specify the full path, just the name, because we will search all folders until we find it
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="opts" type="array">
    Includes options to control the behavior of the chart. For example, react to changes in the parameters to update the data immediately.

    [See the Reactive To Params section](#reactive-to-params) to learn more about it.
</ParamField>

### Reactive To Params

Within the `opts` property we can include some options to modify the behavior of the chart. At the moment only the `reactiveToParams` option is available.

<ParamField path="reactiveToParams" type="boolean">
    If true, the chart will react to any change in the params to update the data displayed without the need to run the view manually.
</ParamField>

```js
<Table
	query='orders_evolution'
    opts={{
        reactiveToParams: true
    }}
/>
```
