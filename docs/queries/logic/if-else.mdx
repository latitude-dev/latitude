## Introduction

The logic blocks supports conditional execution through the use of if and else, allowing SQL code to be executed only when certain conditions are met.

## Syntax

The syntax of these conditions is as follows:

### Simple Conditions
Includes the code only if the condition is true, without an alternative.

```
{#if id > 100}
    ...
{/if}
```

### Conditions with Else
Allow two content alternatives. If the condition is not true, the content defined after `{:else}` will be included.
   
```
{#if id > 100}
    ...
{:else}
    ...
{/if}
```

### Multiple Conditions
Allow unlimited content alternatives. It evaluates conditions cascading until one is met. If none is met, it returns the content defined after `{:else}`.

```
{#if id > 100}
    ...
{:else if > 50}
    ...
{:else if > 25}
    ...
{:else}
    ...
{/if}
```

## Expressions

Expressions are crucial for determining the logic within if and else constructs. They can evaluate variables, constants, or any combination of the two using a variety of operators.

### Values

Values can be inside expressions:

- **Literals**: Such as numeric values (`123`), strings (`'Hello'`), or boolean values (`true`, `false`).
    ```
    {#if id > 100} -- numeric values
    {#if name = 'John'} -- strings
    {#if active = true} -- boolean
    ```
- **Variables/Parameters**: References to values passed to the template. For example, `userId` could be a variable representing a user's ID.
    ```
    {#if id = {userID}} 
    -- Which results in:
    {#if id = 64} 
    ```

### Operators

Expressions are compared with operators, which include the following options:

- **Equality and Inequality**:
  - `==`: Equal to
    ```
    {#if id == 100}
    ```
  - `!=`: Not equal to
    ```
    {#if id != 100}
    ```
- **Greater Than or Less Than**:
  - `>`: Greater than
    ```
    {#if id > 100}
    ```
  - `<`: Less than
    ```
    {#if id < 100}
    ```
  - `<=`: Less than or equal to
    ```
    {#if id <= 100}
    ```
  - `>=`: Greater than or equal to
    ```
    {#if id >= 100}
    ```
- **Multiple conditions**:
  - `&&`: Logical AND to concatenate multiple conditions in the same expression. **They must all be true to continue**.
    ```
    {#if id > 100 && workspace_id = 45}
    ```
  - `||`: Logical OR to concatenate multiple conditions in the same expression. **At least one of them must be true to continue**.
    ```
    {#if id > 100 || workspace_id = 45}
    ```
