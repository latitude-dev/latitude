## Introduction

The logic blocks supports conditional execution through the use of if and else, allowing dynamic SQL code to be executed only when certain conditions are met.

## Syntax

The syntax of these conditions is as follows:

### Simple Conditions
Includes the code only if the condition is true, without an alternative.

```jsx
{#if param('user_id') > 100}
    -- ...
{/if}
```

### Conditions with Else
Allow two content alternatives. If the condition is not true, the content defined after `{:else}` will be included.
   
```jsx
{#if param('user_id') > 100}
    -- ...
{:else}
    -- ...
{/if}
```

### Multiple Conditions
Allow unlimited content alternatives. It evaluates conditions cascading until one is met. If none is met, it returns the content defined after `{:else}`.

```jsx
{#if param('user_id') > 100}
    -- ...
{:else param('user_id') > 50}
    -- ...
{:else param('user_id') > 25}
    -- ...
{:else}
    -- ...
{/if}
```

## Expressions

Expressions are crucial for determining the logic within if and else constructs. They can evaluate variables, constants, or any combination of the two using a variety of operators.

### Values

Values can be inside expressions:

- **Query parameters**: Values passed to the query. For example, `param('user_id')` could be a query parameter representing a user's ID. Check out [Query Parameters](/queries/logic/parameters) for more information.
    ```jsx
    {#if param('user_id') == 64} 
    ```
- **Variables/Parameters**: Variables can be defined in the query and used in expressions. For example, `id` could be a variable representing a user's ID. Check out [Parameters](/queries/logic/variables) for more information.
    ```jsx
    {id = param('user_id')}
    {max_id = 100}

    {#if id > max_id} 
      -- ...
    {/if}
    ```

### Operations

Complex operations can be performed within expressions:

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Basic arithmetic operations can be performed within expressions.
    ```jsx
    {#if param('user_id') * 2 > 100}
    ```

- **String Operations**: String operations can be performed within expressions.
    ```jsx
    {#if param('username').length > 5}
    ```

### Comparisons

Expressions are compared with operators, which include the following options:

- **Equality and Inequality**:
  - `==`: Equal to
    ```jsx
    {#if id == 100}
    ```
  - `!=`: Not equal to
    ```jsx
    {#if id != 100}
    ```
- **Greater Than or Less Than**:
  - `>`: Greater than
    ```jsx
    {#if id > 100}
    ```
  - `<`: Less than
    ```jsx
    {#if id < 100}
    ```
  - `<=`: Less than or equal to
    ```jsx
    {#if id <= 100}
    ```
  - `>=`: Greater than or equal to
    ```jsx
    {#if id >= 100}
    ```
- **Multiple conditions**:
  - `&&`: Logical AND to concatenate multiple conditions in the same expression. **They must all be true to continue**.
    ```jsx
    {#if id > 100 && workspace_id = 45}
    ```
  - `||`: Logical OR to concatenate multiple conditions in the same expression. **At least one of them must be true to continue**.
    ```jsx
    {#if id > 100 || workspace_id = 45}
    ```
