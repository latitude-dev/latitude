## Introduction

Loops allow you to add a SQL code for each item in a collection.

## Syntax

The syntax for a loop is defined by three main components:
```jsx
{#each collection as item, index}
  /* code */
{/each}
```
  - **Collection**: An iterable object that contains the items to be looped over. This can be a manual array, an expression or an existing variable.
  - **Item**: The current element in the collection for this iteration. This will define a new variable only available within the loop.
  - **Index** (optional): The current index of the item in the collection, starting by 0. As with the item, this will define a new variable only available within the loop.

Let's see an example of how it works:
<CodeGroup>
```jsx Your Query
SELECT
{#each ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"] as column_name, i}
  {i} AS {column_name},
{/each}
```
```sql Compiled SQL
SELECT
  0 AS "a",
  1 AS "b",
  2 AS "c",
  3 AS "d",
  4 AS "e",
```
</CodeGroup>

You can also add an `{:else}` block after the loop, which would be executed if the collection is empty:

```jsx
{#each collection as item, index}
  /* code for each item */
{:else}
  /* code if there are no items */
{/each}
```

## Use cases

### Avoiding repetitive code

Now, consider the scenario where you need to aggregate amounts by categories such as fashion, technology, food and sport. The SQL code would look like this:

```sql
SELECT
    sum(case when category = 'fashion' then amount end) as fashion_amount,
    sum(case when category = 'technology' then amount end) as technology_amount,
    sum(case when category = 'food' then amount end) as food_amount
    sum(case when category = 'sport' then amount end) as sport_amount
FROM table
```

Instead of writing repetitive code, you can use a loop to iterate over the categories and generate the SQL code dynamically:

<CodeGroup>
```jsx Your Query
{categories = ["fashion", "technology", "food", "sport"]}

SELECT
    {#each categories as category_name, i}
        sum(case when category = {category_name} then amount end) as {category_name}_amount

        /* Add a comma at the end of each item except the last one */
        {#if i + 1 < categories.length} , {/if}
    {/each}
FROM table
```
```sql Compiled SQL
SELECT
    sum(case when category = 'fashion' then amount end) as fashion_amount,
    sum(case when category = 'technology' then amount end) as technology_amount,
    sum(case when category = 'food' then amount end) as food_amount,
    sum(case when category = 'sport' then amount end) as sport_amount
FROM table
```
</CodeGroup>

### Iterating over other query results

You can also use loops to iterate over the results of another query. For example, if you have a list of users and you want to get the total amount spent by each user, you can use a loop to iterate over the user IDs:

<CodeGroup>
```jsx Your Query
{results = runQuery('users')}

SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE user_id IN (
    {#each results as row, i}
        {#if i > 0} , {/if} /* Add a comma before each item except the first one */
        {row.id}
    {/each}
)
```
```sql Compiled SQL
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE user_id IN (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) -- Assuming the user IDs are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```
