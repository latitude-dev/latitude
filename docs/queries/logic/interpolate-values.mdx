## Introduction 
Interpolating values directly into SQL queries allow to replace values dynamically. This approach allows flexible query construction but must be used with caution to prevent security vulnerabilities.


## Syntax
### Interpolation

Interpolation refers to inserting values directly into the SQL code. In the example above we are using a variable enclosed with `{ }` to embed the value from the variable into the query.

``` sql
---- Using a placeholder in the documentation to demonstrate interpolation ----
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE company = '{companyFiltered}'

```
It is transformed into:
```
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE company = 'latitude'
```

### Parameters

param()
interpolate ()
interpolate(param())

<Note>Note: Direct interpolation can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities if the interpolated values are not properly sanitized.</Note>
