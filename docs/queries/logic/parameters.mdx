description: 'Insert values dynamically into SQL queries from the URL or view inputs'

## Introduction 
In some cases, we want to retrieve data based on some dynamic input, for example, when a user requests data for the past year. This is something we can't guess in our SQL code, so we allow some parts of the code to change.

The function of introducing values from external inputs into the SQL code is parameters.

## Parameters
`param()` retrieves the value from an input and inserts it into the SQL code to generate results dynamically. If there is no value in the input, the query containing a pram() will fail.

``` js
<Input param="company_id" value="Latitude" />
```

``` sql
sql my_query.sql
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE id != {param('company_id')} -- This is where the data from Input is inserted.
```


<Note>It only works in `.sql` files</Note>

### Example

1. **Configure the input in our view**

    ```html my_view.html
    <Input param="custom_input_name" value="Jon" />
    ```
    This tag creates a text input field in which the user can enter a value. The value entered is identified by the `param()` property, which in this case, is `custom_input_name`.

    <Note>This example uses Input but it would work with any component that can contain the `param()` property. See the [Components](../../components/) for more information.</Note>

2. **Working with Parameters in SQL queries**

    To use the input parameter within an SQL query, use the `param()` function. This function retrieves the value specified by the user and inserts it directly into the query.

    ```sql my_query.sql
    SELECT 
        first_name,
        last_name
    FROM users
    WHERE first_name != {param(custom_input_name)}
    ```

    In this example, the `param()` function is used to insert the user's input (as specified by `custom_input_name`) into the SELECT statement. This dynamically modifies the query based on user input.
    
    ```sql my_query.sql result
    SELECT 
        first_name,
        last_name
    FROM users
    WHERE first_name != 'John'
    ```
### Fallback

You can set a fallback in case the input parameter is empty. It's the second argument to the `param()` function:

```
param('input_value', 'fallback')
```

This is an example of a possible error when using `param()`. Let's say we have an input whose `value` property is empty:

```js
    <Input param="user_info" value="" />
```

And it's being used like this in the query:

```
SELECT {param(user_info)}
FROM table
```

The query will fail because it will not get any value. But if we add the fallback `first_name` in case the input is empty, the query will get the second argument. In this case it is a string, but it can be a variable or other logic.

```
SELECT {param(user_info, 'first_name')}
FROM table
```

Final query:

```
SELECT first_name
FROM table
```

## Inline Parameters

`inlineParams` help to modify the data for a specific component in views while `param()` only works in `.sql` files. All components that receive data with the property `query` can accept the `inlineParams`.


``` js comparison_view.html
<Input param="customer_id"/>

<LineChart
  query="data"
  inlineParams={{
    id: input("customer_id")
  }}
/>
/>
```

Inside `inlineParams` we make the match between `query_param_name` and `input_param_name` to send the parameter from the input to the SQL query with the name that is waiting.


<Note>It works only in `.html` files with components that accept the `query` property to receive data. See the [Components](../../components/) for more information.</Note>

### Example

Suppose we want to compare the information of two users in the same view.

1. **Query and view setup**
    
    We have the following query as base:

    ```sql users.sql
    SELECT *
    FROM users
    WHERE id = {param('user_id')}
    ```

    And in the view we have two inputs and two line charts:

    ```js comparison_view.html
    <Input param="first_user_id" />
    <Input param="second_user_id" />

    <LineChart query="user_data" />
    <LineChart query="user_data" />
    ```
    
    This will fail because our query is expecting the param `user_id` but the inputs name in the view are sending the data to `first_user_id` and `second_user_id` params.

2. **Adding inlineParams** 

    What we can do is send `first_user_id` and `second_user_id` params as the `user_id` to the query and then retrieve two results, one for each input. 

    ``` js comparison_view.html
    <Input param="first_user_id" />
    <Input param="second_user_id" />

    <LineChart
        query="user_data"
        inlineParams={{ // We add the inlineParams to modify the params we send
            user_id: input("first_user_id") // We send first_user_id as user_id
        }}
    />
    <LineChart
        query="user_data"
        inlineParams={{ // We add the inlineParams to modify the params we send
            user_id: input("second_user_id") // We send second_user_id as user_id
        }}
    />
    ```

    This way we use `users.sql` as template and return two different results based on the two inputs to show two different charts.

    `first_user_id` = 24
    | id    | created_at | amount   |  
    | ----- | ---------- | -------- |  
    | 24    | 2024       |  4,159   |  
    | 24    | 2023       |  3,780   |  
    | 24    | 2022       |  5,211   |  
    | 24    | 2021       |  9,864   |  

    `second_user_id` = 91
    | id    | created_at | amount   |  
    | ----- | ---------- | -------- |  
    | 91    | 2024       |  6,205   |  
    | 91    | 2023       |  4,981   |  
    | 91    | 2022       |  2,904   |  
    | 91    | 2021       |  7,333   |
