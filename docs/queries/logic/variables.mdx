## Introduction

Variables and constants store values you can later use anywhere in your query.

## Basic Usage
Variables are placeholders that can be assigned and reassigned values throughout the SQL code.

To assign a value to a variable, use the equal sign `=` followed by the value.
```
{name = 'foo'}
{age = 30}
{sum = 2 + 4} 
```

Example in use:
```sql
---- Defining the variable and SQL code ----

{sum = 2 + 4} 

SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE id = {sum}

---- ⬇️ After proccessing ⬇️ ----

SELECT *
FROM database
WHERE id = 6
```
### Incrementing
Variables can be modified using operations such as addition.
```sql
{counter = 10} -- Define the variable

SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE id != null
AND (
{#each [1, 2, 3] as products, i}
  id = {counter}                       -- Print the value of the variable
  {counter = counter + 10}             -- Increment the value of the variable
  {#if i+1 < products.length} OR {/if} -- Add an OR to every element except the last one
{/each}
)

---- ⬇️ After proccessing ⬇️ ----

SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE id != null 
AND (
  id = 10 OR
  id = 20 OR
  id = 30
)
```

## Constants
Constants are similar to variables but, once defined, their value cannot be changed. Also the main syntax difference is constants are defined using the `@const` keyword.

```
{@const name = 'value'}
```

```sql
---- Defining the constant and SQL code ----

{@const birthday = '2000/02/28'} 

SELECT *
FROM table
{#if birthday = '2000/02/28'}
    {birthday = '2024/12/31'} 
{/if}


---- ⬇️ After proccessing ⬇️ ----

'!Error: Cannot reassign a constant'
```

## Scope
### Global
Variables defined outside of any logic blocks are considered global and can be modified and accessed throughout the entire code.
```
{var1 = 'latitude'}
```

### Local Variables
Variables defined within logic blocks are local to that block. They cannot be accessed outside the block in which they are defined.

``` 
{#if condition}
    {var2 = 'localValue'} -- Accessible only within this block
{/if}
```
