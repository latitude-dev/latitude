## Introduction

Variables and constants store values you can later use anywhere in your query.

## Basic Usage
Variables are placeholders that can be assigned and reassigned values throughout the SQL code.

To assign a value to a variable, use the equal sign `=` followed by the value.
```
{name = 'foo'}
{age = 30}
{sum = 2 + 4} 
```

Example in use:
```sql
---- Defining the variable and SQL code ----

{sum = 2 + 4} 

SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE id = {sum}

```
It is transformed into:
```

SELECT *
FROM database
WHERE id = 6
```
### Incrementing
Variables can be modified using operations such as addition.
```sql

{counter = counter + 10}

SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE id != null
AND (

{#each [1, 2, 3] as products}
OR id = {counter}
{/each}
)

```
It is transformed into:
```

SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE id != null 

AND id = 10
AND id = 20
AND id = 30
```

## Constants
Constants are similar to variables but, once defined, their value cannot be changed. Also the main syntax difference is constants are defined using the `@const` keyword.

```
{@const name = 'value'}
```

```sql
---- Defining the constant and SQL code ----

{@const birthday = '2000/02/28'} 

SELECT *
FROM table
{#if birthday = '2000/02/28'}
    {@const birthday = '2024/12/31'} 
{/if}


```
It is transformed into:
```

'!Error. You are trying to modify the constant content'
```

## Scope
### Global
Variables defined outside of any logic blocks are considered global and can be modified and accessed throughout the entire code.
```
{var1 = 'latitude'}
```

### Local Variables
Variables defined within logic blocks are local to that block. They cannot be accessed outside the block in which they are defined.

``` 
{#if condition}
    {var2 = 'localValue'} -- Accessible only within this block
{/if}
```
