## Introduction

To make things faster and minimize wait times, Latitude stores the results of your queries in a cache layer.

##  How It Works

 - **Cached by default**
   
    The first time you run a query, the results are automatically cached. This means that the next time you visit the view, it will load almost instantly.

 - **You can refresh data by**:
 
   - Running the query using the RunButton in a view. See the page [Run Button](/views/components/interaction/run-button) for more information.
   - Forcing a view to run by query parameters in the URL. See the section [Forcing Refresh with Query Param](#forcing-refresh-with-query-param) for more information.

 - **No Expiration**

    The cached data doesn't expire. It remains stored until you either click the Run button or use a special URL parameter that updates and overwrites the cached data.
   
 ## Forcing Refresh With Query Param

You can use the `__force` parameter to force a refresh of results on a specific page. 

See the page [parameters](/queries/logic/parameters) to learn how queyr params work.
