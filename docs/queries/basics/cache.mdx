## Introduction

To improve performance and reduce waiting times Latitude store the results of your queries in a cache layer.

##  How it works

 - **Cached by default**
   
   Once run all results are cached by default. This means that once executed a view next time you acess you will see the results loaded without waiting times.

 - **You can refresh data by**:
 
   - Executing the query through RunButton in a view. See the page [Run Button](/components/interaction/run-button) to learn more.
   - Forcing the run of a view through query params in the URL. See the section [Forcing Refresh With Query Param](#forcing-refresh-with-query-param) to learn more.

 - **No Expiration**

   There is no expiration date on the cache. The cache will be kept until the Run button or the Force parameter updates the view data and overwrites the cache version.
   
 ## Forcing Refresh With Query Param

You can force the refresh of results on a specific page with the param `__force` 

See the page [parameters](/queries/logic/parameters) to learn how queyr params work.
