## Introduction 

Before you start retrieving data, there are two important things to consider: the configuration of the query files and the sources from which you will retrieve data.

## File Requirements

Queries are stored in files, and here are the necessary specifications and options:

- **Source Files**: Must be `.sql`.
- **Location**: All query files should be placed in the `queries` directory. This includes nesting in any subdirectories under `queries`.

    ```
    queries/
    ├── my_first_query.sql
    └── product/
        └── active_users.sql
    ```

- **Naming**: The `.sql` filename is the one you can use to reference one query in another. See [Referencing other queries](sql-syntax-basics#from) for more information.
- **Co-Location**: `.sql` query files and `.yaml` source files must all reside within the queries directory or its subdirectories. See [How to Configure Sources](sql-syntax-basics#from) for more information.
    ```
    queries/
    └── product/
        ├── active_users.sql
        └── snowflake_product.yaml
    ```

## Sources

### Configuration
The first step is to configure a source. To learn more about how to do this, see [How to configure Sources](../../sources/how-to-configure-sources.mdx)

### Source Resolution
It is important understand the source resolution when creating a query. [Check Source Resolution](../../sources/how-to-configure-sources#source-esolution)
