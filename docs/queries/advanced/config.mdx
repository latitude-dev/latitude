In addition to your own source's behaviour, you can configure how Latitude will handle the data in each specific query. This can be done by adding a `config` tag to the query itself.
This keyword will not be included in the query that gets sent to your source, but it defines how Latitude will handle the data.

## Syntax

A `config` tag is defined as a key-value object in the query. Here's an example:
```sql
{@config ttl = 3600} -- 1 hour of lifetime
SELECT *
FROM my_table
```

<Note>
  Any `@config` value must be defined using a literal value, without any variables or expressions. Using variables or expressions will result in a syntax error.
</Note>

## Default configuration

If you want to set a default configuration for all the queries in a source, you can do so by adding a `config` object in the source schema. Go to [Source additional configuration](/sources/additional-config) for more information.
