title: 'Run Query'
description: 'Dynamically executes SQL queries, ideal for generating SQL code with runtime-known values.'

##Introduction

The `runQuery` function allows you to dynamically execute SQL queries based on the results of a previous query. This functionality is particularly useful when you need to dynamically generate column names or perform operations based on values that are not known until runtime.

## Syntax

The syntax is `runQuery` + `('query_file_name_to_run')`. This would return the whole query.

The `payment_methods.sql` results are:

|id    | payment_method |
| ---- | -------------- |
|1     | cash           |
|2     | credit_card    |
|3     | transfer       |
|4     | promotion      |



You can run a query from another one. For instace in `purchases_validation` we are going to run the `payment_methods` one.

``` sql purchases_validation
{results = runQuery('payment_methods')}
```
Then you can access a specific row with:
``` sql payment_validation
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE payment_method IS NOT null
{#each row in results}
  OR payment_method = {payment_type = row['payment_method']}
{/each}

```
It is transformed into:
```
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE payment_method IS NOT null
  OR payment_method = cash
  OR payment_method = credit_card
  OR payment_method = transfer
  OR payment_method = promotion
```


### Example

Consider a scenario where you have a `payments` table and you want to generate a table that shows the total amount for each payment method, along with a column for the total amount. The steps would be as follows:

1. **Identify Different Payment Methods**:

```sql
-- payment_methods.sql
SELECT DISTINCT payment_method FROM payments
ORDER BY 1
```

2. **Generate Report Based on Distinct Payment Methods**:

Generate a report based on distinct payment methods:
Using the results of the first query, `runQuery` is called to dynamically generate a second SQL query. This second query aggregates the payment amounts by each different payment method obtained from the first query.
<Note>Remember to enclose any latitude logic in curly braces `{ }`</Note>

```sql
-- my_model.sql
{results = runQuery('payment_methods')}   -- Here we put in a variable the results from the payment_methods query
SELECT
  order_id,
  {#each row in results}    -- We create a loop to add the specfied SQL code for each row after run payment_methods
    {payment_type = row['payment_method']}    -- We create a variable that contain the value from payment_method column
    SUM(
        CASE WHEN payment_method = {payment_type}    -- We compare the current value of the loop with the
        THEN amount END
    ) AS {payment_type}_amount,
  {/each}
  SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM payments
GROUP BY 1
```

This approach is essential for creating dynamic SQL queries that adjust based on actual database contents, which is not directly possible with standard SQL due to its static nature.
