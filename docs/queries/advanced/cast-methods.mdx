# Cast Method

The `cast` method allows you to convert values between different types within the Latitude logic blocks, enclosed in curly brackets `{ }`. This functionality ensures that the data types of variables are suitable for the operations you wish to perform.

## Example

Consider a scenario where you have a parameter named `limit`, but the user has provided a value as a string, `"3"`, instead of a numeric value. To correctly perform a comparison operation, you need the value to be of a numeric type.

Without casting, the comparison in the following block would not work as expected:

```
{#if limit > 5}
content 1
{:else}
content 2
{/if}
```


This is because, with `limit = "3"`, you're comparing the string `"3"` to the number `5`, which leads to an incorrect comparison.

### Solution: Using `cast`

To resolve this, you can use the `cast` function to convert `limit` to an integer:

```
{#if cast(limit, "int") > 5}
content 1
{:else}
content 2
{/if}
```

This way, if `limit` is `"3"`, it gets converted to the numeric value `3` before the comparison, ensuring the operation is correctly performed.

## Accepted Casting Types

You can cast values to various types using the `cast` method. The following are the accepted types for casting:

- `string` or `text`: Converts the value to a string. Both `string` and `text` perform the same function.
- `int`: Converts the value to an integer.
- `float` or `number`: Converts the value to a floating-point number. Both `float` and `number` are treated similarly.
- `bool` or `boolean`: Converts the value to a boolean. Both `bool` and `boolean` are interchangeable and perform the same function.
- `date`: Converts the value to a date.
