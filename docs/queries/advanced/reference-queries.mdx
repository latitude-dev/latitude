## Introduction

The Reference Queries feature allows you to include SQL code from another file in your current SQL query. This is useful for reusing common parts of a query, ensuring that your SQL code is consistent and easy to maintain.

## How It Works

To reference SQL code from another file, use the syntax `{ref ('other_query')}`, where `other_query` is the name of another `.sql` file located in the `/queries` folder. This syntax imports the raw SQL code from the specified file to the location where it is added.

### Referencing queries as a source

An important use case for referencing queries is adding them as source. You can do this as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM {ref ('users_clean')}
```

Which will translate to:

```sql users_clean.sql
SELECT id, first_name, ...
FROM users
```

```
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT
        id,
        first_name,
        last_name,
        email
)
```

### About queries path resolution

When you reference a query, the path is resolved relative to the current query. This means that you can reference queries in the same folder, in a parent folder, or in a sibling folder.

Assuming you are editing `queries/users/query.sql` and you want to reference `/queries/users/orders` query:

```
queries/
  users/
    query.sql
    orders/
      query.sql
```

```sql
-- queries/users/query.sql
SELECT *
FROM {ref ('orders/query')}
```

This is equivalent to use a relative path:

```sql
-- queries/users/query.sql
SELECT *
FROM {ref ('./orders/query')}
```

## Absolute paths.
You can also reference queries with a `/` prefix. This means the path of the query is resolved from the root of queries folder.
Following the previous example, you can reference `/queries/users/orders` query as follows:

```sql
-- queries/users/query.sql
SELECT *
FROM {ref ('/users/orders/query.sql')}
```

<Note>`queries` folder doesn't need to be included in the path. Also `.sql` is optional. You can add if you want</Note>
