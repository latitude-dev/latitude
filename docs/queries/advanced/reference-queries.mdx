## Introduction

The Reference Queries feature allows you to include SQL code from another file in your current SQL query. This is useful for reusing common parts of a query, ensuring that your SQL code is consistent and easy to maintain.

## How It Works

To reference SQL code from another file, use the syntax `{ref ('other_query')}`, where `other_query` is the name of another `.sql` file located in the `/queries` folder. This syntax imports the raw SQL code from the specified file to the location where it is added.

### Code Example

Assuming that you have a file named `other_query.sql` in the `/queries` folder, you can include its SQL code in your current query as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM {ref ('other_query')}
```
This will dynamically insert the SQL code from `other_query.sql` into your current query, allowing you to build complex queries by reusing existing blocks of code.

### Referencing queries as a source

An important use case for referencing queries is adding them as source. You can do this as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM {ref ('users_clean')}
```

Which will translate to:

```sql users_clean.sql
SELECT id, first_name, ...
FROM users
```

```
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT 
        id,
        first_name,
        last_name,
        email
)
```
