## Introduction

Interpolation refers to inserting values directly into the SQL code without parametrization.

In order to prevent SQL injection attacks, Latitude [parameterizes](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet.html)
all queries to your db, by default. Parameter interpolation bypasses this protection and users should use it at their own risk. Read more about it
in the [SQL Syntax](/queries/basics/sql-syntax-basics#adding-values-to-the-query) section.

<Warning>Direct interpolation can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities, allowing users to perform critical actions such as deleting a table.</Warning>

## Why use interpolation?

There are some cases where you might want to interpolate a value directly into the SQL query.
- **unparameterizable values**: Depending on the database engine, some values cannot be parameterized. For example, table names cannot be parameterized in PostgreSQL.

  For example:
  ```sql
    SELECT
      user_name as {param('column_name')}
    FROM users
  ```
  Running this query in PostgreSQL will throw an error because the column name cannot be parameterized. To fix it, we must interpolate the column name directly into the query:
  ```sql
    SELECT
      user_name as {interpolate(param('column_name'))}
    FROM users
  ```

- **Dynamic query keywords**: Most database engines only let you parameterize values, not keywords. For example, you cannot parameterize the `DESC` or `ASC` keyword in some engines.
  ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM users
    ORDER BY users.id {param('order')}
  ```
  In order to fix this, you can interpolate the keyword directly into the query:
  ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM users
    ORDER BY users.id {interpolate(param('order'))}
  ```

## Syntax

`interpolate()` allows you to send any parenthesized logic directly to the database. Let's look at some examples:

```sql
interpolate({your_logic_here})
```

Take into account that interpolating any value will just add it straight to the query. This means that interpolating a string will not add quotes around it, so you must add them manually if needed.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE company = \'{interpolate('company_name')}\'
```

Here we are also adding quotes around the interpolation to make sure the query is correctly formatted. We are also escaping the quotes, because otherwise everything inside a string is just considered a regular string and not compiled by Latitude.

## Example

### Without interpolation

**Original query:**
  ```sql
  {companyName = 'Latitude'}

  SELECT *
  FROM table
  WHERE company = {companyName}
  ```

**Compiled query:**
  
  The compiled query will have references to the values instead of the actual parameters.

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM table
  WHERE company = $1
  ```

  The values for each reference will be sent to your database separately.

  `$1 = 'Latitude'`

  This process is done differently depending on the database engine you are using, but all of them are secure and prevent SQL injection attacks.


### With interpolation

**Original query:**
  ```sql
  {companyName = 'Latitude'}

  SELECT *
  FROM table
  WHERE company = \'{interpolate(companyName)}\'
  ```

**Compiled query:**

  Here the compiled query will contain the actual value of the parameter we used.

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM table
  WHERE company = 'Latitude'
  ```
  
  Be careful with this approach, as the value is directly inserted into the query, which can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### Other uses

You can use `interpolate()` with any logic, for example with `param()` which is an interesting use case to send the value from URL or inputs in the raw SQL code.
