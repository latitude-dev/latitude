description: 'Insert values into SQL queries without parametization'

## Introduction

Interpolation refers to inserting values directly into the SQL code but without parametrization.

By default, all of Latitude's logic is parametrized to independently send the query and values to the database and to detect possible SQL injection. Interpolating a value breaks the parametrization.

<Warning>Direct interpolation can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities, allowing users to perform critical actions such as deleting a table.</Warning>

## Syntax

`interpolate()` allows you to send any parenthesized logic directly to the database. Let's look at some examples:

```
interpolate({your_logic_here})
```

- **Variable without interpolation**

    ``` sql variable.sql
    {companyFiltered = 'Latitude'}

    SELECT *
    FROM table
    WHERE company = {companyFiltered}
    ```
    Will send the query parametized:
    ``` sql
    SELECT *
    FROM table
    WHERE company = $1
    ```
    And the value of `$1` independently:
    ``` js
    $1 = 'Latitude'
    ```
    This allows databases to check the values and see if there is a security vulnerability.

- **Variable with interpolation**

    ``` sql variable.sql
    {companyFiltered = 'Latitude'}

    SELECT *
    FROM table
    WHERE company = {interpolate({companyFiltered})}
    ```
    Will send the query as it is:
    ``` sql
    SELECT *
    FROM table
    WHERE company = 'Latitude'
    ```

### Other uses

You can use `interpolate()` with any logic, for example with `param()` which is an interesting use case to send the value from URL or inputs in the raw SQL code.
