## Introduction

The `<Card>` component is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options.

## Usage

To use the `<Card>`, import it to your component and pass the content you want to display as children.

There are three main parts to the card component: the header, the body, and the footer. You can use any combination of these parts to create the card you need.

Here's a basic example of a card with a header, body, and footer:

```tsx
import { Card } from '@latitude-data/react';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Card.Root>
    <Card.Header>
      <Text.H2>Card title</Text.H2>
    </Card.Header>
    <Card.Content>
      <Text>The content of the card can be anything. Here's some arbitrary text.</Text>
    </Card.Content>
    <Card.Footer class='px-6 py-2'>
      <Text color='text-muted'>This is a card footer with a long explainer</Text>
    </Card.Footer>
  </Card.Root>
);
```

## Theme properties

By default, the `<Card>` will use the `card` and `card-foreground` properties from the theme.
