## Introduction

The `Button` component is a simple button that can be used to trigger actions in your app.

## Usage

To use the `Button` component, add the text you want to display on the button as children, and pass any additional props you need.

```tsx
const MyComponent = () => (
  <Button
    type='primary'
    size='md'
    onClick={() => alert('Button clicked!')}
  >
    Click me
  </Button>
);
```
