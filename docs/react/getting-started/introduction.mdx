description: 'What is Latitude for React'
---

If you already have an existing React project or you are planning to build one, Latitude for React is the perfect companion to help you build your app using Latitude.

This is **NOT** a standalone package. You need to have a Latitude project running to configure and run queries.
This package allows you to have a better integration between your Latitude project and your React app, giving you control over the whole front-end experience.
Learn more about what Latitude is and how to get started with it in the [main documentation](/guides/getting-started/introduction).

This package provides a set of components and hooks that allow you to interact with your Latitude project's API and handle the data in your React app, or just embed configured views directly in your app.
