## Introduction

The data returned by the [useQuery](/react/running-queries/use-query) function is an instance of `QueryResult`, which contains the results of the query along with some additional information.

## Properties

<ParamField path="rowCount" type="number">
  The number of rows returned by the query.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="fields" type="Field[]">
  An array of `Field` objects, each one representing a column in the query result. Each `Field` object has the following properties:

  - `name`: The name of the column.
  - `type`: The type of the column data.

  The `type` property can be one of the following values: `string`, `integer`, `float`, `boolean`, `datetime`, `null`, `unknown`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="rows" type="unknown[][]">
  An array of rows returned by the query. Each row is represented by an array of values, where each element in the array corresponds to a field in the query result.
</ParamField>

## Methods

If you need to export the data into different formats, you can use the following methods:

### `.serialize()`

Serializes the query result into a JavaScript object.

```json
{
  "rowCount": 2,
  "fields": [
    { "name": "id", "type": "integer" },
    { "name": "name", "type": "string" }
  ],
  "rows": [
    [1, "Alice"],
    [2, "Bob"]
  ]
}
```

### `.toJSON()`

Serializes the query result into a JSON string.

```json
"{\"rowCount\":2,\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"id\",\"type\":\"integer\"},{\"name\":\"name\",\"type\":\"string\"}],\"rows\":[[1,\"Alice\"],[2,\"Bob\"]]}"
```

### `.toCSV()`

Serializes the query result into a CSV string.

```json
"id,name \n 1,\"Alice\" \n 2,\"Bob\""
```

### `.toArray()`

Serializes the query result into an array of objects, where each object represents a row in the query result.
  
```json
[
  { "id": 1, "name": "Alice" },
  { "id": 2, "name": "Bob" }
]
```
