## Introduction

Although there are some components that can run queries automatically, you can also run them manually from your React app, and do whatever you want with the results.

## Running queries

To run a query from your React app, you can use the provided `useQuery` function.

This function has the following options:

### Properties

<ParamField path="queryPath" type="string" required>
  The path of the query you want to run.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="params" type="object">
  The variables you want to pass to the query.
</ParamField>

[See the Queries section](/queries/basics/file-structure) to learn more about the query configuration.

### Returned attributes

<ParamField path="data" type="QueryResult | null">
  The data returned by the query. Will be `null` if the query is still running or if there was an error.
  
  Check [QueryResult](/react/running-queries/query-result) to learn more about the data structure.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="isFetching" type="boolean">
  A boolean that indicates if the query is still running.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="error" type="Error">
  The error returned by the query. Will be `null` if there was no error.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="compute" type="function">
  A function that allows you to run the query again.
</ParamField>

## Example

```tsx
import { useQuery, Table } from '@latitude-data/react'

export default function Example() {
  const { data, isFetching, error, compute } = useQuery({
    queryPath: 'titles/titles-table'
  })

  return (
    <div className='p-4 flex flex-col gap-y-4'>
      <h1>React Example with Latitude</h1>
      <Button onClick={compute}>Refresh</Button>

      {isFetching && <p>Loading movies...</p>}
      {error && <p>There has been an error: {error.message}</p>}
      {data && (
        <div>
          <p>There are {data.rowCount} results:</p>
          <Table data={data} />
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```
