## Introduction

Latitude uses [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) for applying styles. This means that you can use all of Tailwind's utility classes in your components.

## Basic usage

Tailwind provides a lot of utility classes that you can use to style your components. For example, you can use the `text-2xl` class to make a text element larger.

```jsx
<View>
    <Text class="text-2xl">Hello world</Text>
</View>
```

You can also use multiple classes to apply multiple styles to an element:

```jsx
<View>
    <Text class="text-2xl text-purple-600">Hello world</Text>
</View>
```

In this case, the text will be larger and purple.

This is the most basic way to use Tailwind classes in your components. We recommend checking out the Tailwind documentation to see all the available classes and how to use them.
