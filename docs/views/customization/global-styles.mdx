## Introduction

Applying global styles to your views is easy. Latitude provides a default theme that you can use as a starting point. You can also create your own themes and apply them to your views.

## Creating a theme

To create a theme, you need to edit the `latitude.json` file in the root of your project. You'll find the current theme under the `themes` key. To create a new theme, simply add a new key to the `themes` object and define your theme.

```json
{
  "themes": {
    "default": {
      "primaryColor": "#FF0000",
      "secondaryColor": "#00FF00",
      "textColor": "#000000"
    },
    "dark": {
      "primaryColor": "#000000",
      "secondaryColor": "#000000",
      "textColor": "#FFFFFF"
    }
  }
}
```

## Applying a theme

To apply a theme to your views, you simply need to add the property `theme` to your `View` component. Here's an example:

```html
<View theme="dark">
  <Text>Hello, world!</Text>
</View>
```
