## Introduction

Views are a powerful way to create custom layouts for your data apps. They allow you to create reusable components that can be used to display your data in a variety of ways. In this guide, we'll take a look at how to use views.

## Routing

In a Latitude data app, routes are inferred from the file structure of your app. For example, if you have a file called `views/index.html`, it will be accessible at the root of your app. 

To create more pages you need nested routes. You can do this by creating a directory with the same name as the route or page you want to create. For example, if you have a file called `views/charts/index.html`, it will be accessible at `/charts`. Consequently, if you have a file called `views/charts/bar/index.html`, it will be accessible at `/charts/bar`.

<Note>So view files must be named as `index.html` and the name of the route is determined by the directory or folder where it is placed.</Note>

If you have a file named `views/about.html`, it won't be accessible because we only allow one file at root level and only files named `index`.

If you have both a file and a directory with the same name, the framework will throw an error.

## Passing parameters

You can pass parameters to a view via URL parameters. For example, if you have a file called `views/user.html`, you can access it at `/user?id=123`. The `id` parameter will be available in the view.

To access the URL parameter in the view, you can use the `url_param()` function. For example, to retrieve the value of the `id` parameter, you can use `url_param('id')`. Here's an example of how you can pass this parameter to a query using a `Value` component:

```html
<Value
  data={
     query_path: 'users', 
     params: {
       id: url_param('id'),
     }
  }
/>
```

URL parameters can also be used to set the initial value of any input component. This happens automatically, so if you have an input component with the name `id`, it will be automatically set to the value of the `id` parameter.
