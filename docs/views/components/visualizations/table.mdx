<TableIframe />

## Introduction
The Table format organizes data in rows and columns, providing a clear view for comparison and detailed analysis. It's ideal for displaying precise values.

## Syntax
You can use `<Table ... />` to add it to your view. Within the tag you must add the properties to configure the chart.

``` js
<Table
	query='orders_evolution'
/>
```

## Properties
To configure and customize the table, simply reference the query from which you want to view the data.

	### Query configuration
	<ParamField path="query" type="string" required>
		The path to the query file that will provide the data displayed in the visualization.
	</ParamField>

	<ParamField path="inlineParams" type="object">
		An object with custom parameters to be used in the query, in addition to the global parameters of the view.
	</ParamField>

	<ParamField path="opts" type="object">
		Includes options to control the behavior of the chart. For example, react to changes in the parameters to update the data immediately.
	</ParamField>

	Refer to the [Running queries](/views/basics/running-queries) section for more information about query configuration.
