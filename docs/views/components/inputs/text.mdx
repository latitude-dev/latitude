## Introduction

Inputs provide a straightforward way to set the values of the [Global Parameters](/views/basics/parameters) of your views. Basically they let you provide a user interface to your queries.

## Basic usage

The most basic usage of an input is to provide a text input for a parameter. You can do this by using the `param` prop to specify the name of the parameter you want to control. `param` is mandatory so if you don't include it the app will return an error.

```jsx
<Input param="name" value="Jon" />
```

This will create a text input that is associated with the `name` parameter. If you load the page with the `name` parameter already in the URL, you will see the value from the URL in the input. You can also provide a default value for the input by using the `value` prop.

If you load the page without the `name` parameter in the URL, the input will be set to the default value. If you load the page with a different value for the `name` parameter in the URL, the input will be set to that value.

## Types

You can also specify the type of input you want to use by using the `type` prop. This works with the `type` attribute of the `<input>` element in HTML. You can use this to specify that the input should be a `number`, `email`, `tel` (phone number), `time`, etc.

```jsx
<Input param="age" type="number" />
```

This will create a number input that is associated with the `age` parameter.

## Properties

In addition to the standard HTML input properties, the `Input` component accepts the following props:
