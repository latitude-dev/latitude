## Introduction

The `RunButton` component lets users manually refetch the contents of a query, or a group of queries, by clicking a button.

See [Refetching a query](/views/basics/running-queries#refetching-a-query) for more information on how queries are fetched.

## Usage

To use the `RunButton` component, simply add it to any view like this:

```jsx
<RunButton>Run</RunButton>
```

When you click the button, it will run all queries being used in the view.

You can also specify a query to run:

```jsx
<RunButton query="users">Run</RunButton>
```

This will run the `users` query when the button is clicked, and it will reactively update the view with the results.

Finally, you can specify an array of queries to run:

```jsx
<RunButton queries={["users", "transactions"]}>Run</RunButton>
```

This will run the `users` and `transactions` queries when the button is clicked, and it will update the view accordingly.
