## Introduction

The `<Text>` component is used to render text in your data app. It lets you easily display and customize your text content.

## Basic usage

To use the `<Text>` component, you can just include it in your views and pass the text you want to display as a child of the component.

```jsx
<Text>
  Hello, world!
</Text>
```

You can use our scale of predefined styles to quickly customize your text. Here's an example:

```jsx
<Text.H1>
  Hello, world!
</Text>
```

This will also render the text as a `<h1>` tag.

These are the predefined styles available for the `<Text>` component, along with their corresponding font size and line height:

| Style | Settings                               |
|-------|----------------------------------------|
| `H1`  | Font size 36px, Line height 48px       |
| `H2`  | Font size 26px, Line height 40px       |
| `H3`  | Font size 20px, Line height 32px       |
| `H4`  | Font size 16px, Line height 24px       |
| `H5`  | Font size 14px, Line height 20px       |
| `H6`  | Font size 12px, Line height 16px       |

## Advanced usage

Apart from the predefined styles, you can also customize the text using the following properties:

<TextProperties />

Here's an example of how you can use these properties:

```jsx
<Text
  color="primary"
  size="h1"
  family="sans"
  weight="bold"
  spacing="wide"
  align="center"
  wordBreak="breakAll"
  whiteSpace="preWrap"
>
  Hello, world!
</Text>
```

## Custom styles

If you want to further customize the text, you can use the `class` property to pass your own styles using Tailwind. Here's an example:

```jsx
<Text class="text-4xl font-bold text-primary">
  Hello, world!
</Text>
```

For a guide on how to use custom styles with Tailwind, check out the [Component styles](/views/customization/component-styles) page.
