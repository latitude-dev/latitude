## Introduction

The `each` block helper is used to iterate over an array or object. It is similar to the `for` loop in other programming languages.

## Basic usage

To use the `each` block helper, you need to pass an array or object to it. The `each` block helper will then iterate over the array or object and execute the block for each item.

```html
{#each [1, 2, 3] as |number|}
  <p>{{number}}</p>
{/each}
```

In the example above, the `each` block helper iterates over the array `[1, 2, 3]` and executes the block for each item. The block is passed the current item as an argument, which is then used to render the paragraph element.

## Iterating over query results

The `each` block helper is often used to iterate over the results of a query. For example, you might want to display a list of blog posts, or a table of users. Since we have to run the query first, similar to the `if` block helper, we can use the `await` block helper to wait for the query to complete before rendering the results.

```html
{#await run_query('users') then users}
  {#each users as user}
    <Card>
      <h2>{{user.name}}</h2>
      <p>{{user.bio}}</p>
    </Card>
  {/each}
{/await}
```

In the example above, we use the `await` block helper to wait for the `run_query` function to complete. Once the query is complete, the `users` variable will contain the results, and we can use the `each` block helper to iterate over the results and render a `Card` component for each user.
