## Introduction

As explained in [Global parameters](/views/basics/parameters), all views have a set of global parameters that can be configured and modified by users.
Although these are managed automatically for running queries, you can also read and display their values in your views using the `param` function.

## Basic usage

Here's an example of how to use the `param` function to read the value of a global parameter:

```jsx
<View>
	<Input param='name' label='Your name' />
	<Text>Hello, {param('name')}!</Text>
</View>
```

In this example, the `Input` component is used to set the value of the `name` parameter, and the `Text` component is used to display the value of the `name` parameter.
The text shown in the `Text` component will be updated automatically whenever the value of the `name` parameter changes.

### Fallback

You can also use parameters that may be present in the URL but do not have any associated Input component.
However, if the parameter is not present in the URL either, you can provide a fallback value as the second argument to the `param` function. Otherwise, the function will return `undefined`.

```jsx
<View>
	<Text>Hello, {param('name', 'unidentified user')}!</Text>
</View>
```
