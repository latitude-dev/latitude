## Introduction

In this guide, we will learn how to use `if` and `else` statements in your views. This is useful when you want to conditionally render some content based on a certain condition.

## Basic Usage

Here's an example of how to use `if` and `else` statements in your views to display a message or a chart depending on whether the query result is empty or not.

```html
<View>
    {#if query('sample')}
        <Chart data={...} />
    {:else}
        <Text>No data available</Text>
    {/if}
</View>
```
