## Introduction

In this guide, we will learn how to use `if` and `else` statements in your views. This is useful when you want to conditionally render some content based on a certain condition.

## Basic usage

Here's an example of how to use `if` and `else` statements in your views to display a message or a chart depending on whether the query result is empty or not.

```html
<View>
    {#if url_param('user_token')}
        <Chart data={...} />
    {:else}
        <Text>No data available</Text>
    {/if}
</View>
```

## Using query results as conditions

You can also use any query result to conditionally render content. To do so, use the `await` syntax to wait for the query to resolve before using the result.

```html
<View>
    {#await runQuery('sample')}
        <Text>Loading...</Text>
    {:then data}
        {#if data.length > 0}
            <Chart data={...} />
        {:else}
            <Text>No data available</Text>
        {/if}
    {:catch error}
        <Text>Error: {error.message}</Text>
    {/await}
</View>
```

Learn more about how to use await in the [Await documentation](/views/logic/await).
