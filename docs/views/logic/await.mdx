## Introduction

The `await` block lets you run functions in a synchronous manner. This is useful when for example you want to use the results of a query in a custom element in your views.

## Basic usage

There are three possible states for the `await` block: `pending`, `fulfilled` and `rejected`. You can use the `{:then}` and `{:catch}` blocks to handle the `fulfilled` and `rejected` states respectively.

```html
{#await run_query('sample')}
    <p>Waiting...</p>
{:then data}
    <p>The value is {data}</p>
{:catch error}
    <p>{error.message}</p>
{/await}
```

If you don't want to show a loading state or an error message, those parts can be omitted:

```html
{#await run_query('sample') then data}
    <p>The value is {data}</p>
{/await}
```
