## Introduction

The `Select` component is used to create a dropdown with predefined options for a parameter. This can be useful when you want to provide a list of options for a parameter that the user can choose from, either to limit the possible values or to make it easier for the user to select a value.
This component can be used both with predefined options and with dynamic options that are loaded from a query result.

## Options

### Predefined options

The most basic usage of a `Select` is to provide a list of options that the user can choose from. You can do this by using the `options` prop to specify an array of options.

```jsx
<Select
	param="user_name"
	options={["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]}
/>
```

You can also use different values for the options than what is displayed in the dropdown by using an array of objects with `value` and `label` properties.

```jsx
<Select
	param="user_id"
	options={[
		{ value: 1, label: "Alice" },
		{ value: 2, label: "Bob" },
		{ value: 3, label: "Charlie" }
	]}
/>
```

In this example, the `value` property is what will be used when running any queries using the parameter, while the `label` property is just what will be displayed in the dropdown.

### Dynamic options

You can also use a query to load the options dynamically. This can be useful when you have a large number of options, when the options change frequently or when you want to filter the options based on other parameters.

```jsx
<Select
	param="user_id"
	query="users"
/>
```

Here, `query_name` is the name of a query that will be ran to load the options. If the results of the query contain a `value` and a `label` property, those will be used as the value and label for the options. Otherwise, the first column will be used as both.

If you want to use a different column as the value, you can specify the `values` and `labels` props to do so.

```jsx
<Select
	param="user_id"
	query="users"
	values="id"
	labels="name"
/>
```

Like with any visualization, where you use a query to load information, you can also use [Inline Params](/queries/logic/parameters#inline-parameters) and [Reactive Params](/queries/logic/parameters#reactive-to-parameters) options to modify how the query behaves. For more information on how the query is configured, check out [Queries Parameters](/queries/logic/parameters).

### Mixed options

You can mix both predefined and dynamic options by using the `options` and `query` props together. The dropdown will first show the predefined options and then load the dynamic options.

```jsx
<Select
	param="category_filter"
	options={[
		{ value: false, label: "Any category" }
	]}
	query="categories"
/>
```

### Default value

You can also add a default value to the dropdown by using the `value` prop. This will preselect the option with the given value when the page is loaded, if it is not overridden by a value in the URL.

```jsx
<Select
	param="user_id"
	options={[
		{ value: 1, label: "Alice" },
		{ value: 2, label: "Bob" },
		{ value: 3, label: "Charlie" }
	]}
	value={2}
/>
```

## Search box

If you have a large number of options, you can enable a search box to make it easier for the user to find the option they are looking for. You can do this by adding the `searchable` prop.

```jsx
<Select
	param="city_id"
	query="cities"
	searchable
/>
```

## Text customization

You can customize the text that is displayed in the dropdown with the following options: `label`, `description` and `placeholder`.
 - `label` is the text that is displayed above the dropdown.
 - `description` is the text that is displayed below the dropdown.
 - `placeholder` is the text that is displayed in the dropdown when no option is selected.

```jsx
<Select
	param="city_id"
	query="cities"
	label="Select a city"
	description="Choose the city you want to filter by."
	placeholder="Select a city..."
/>
```
