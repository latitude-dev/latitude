## Introduction

The `RunButton` component lets users run a query—or a group of queries—by clicking a button.

## Usage

To use the `RunButton` component, simply add it to any view like this:

```html
<RunButton>Run</RunButton>
```

When you click the button, it will run all queries being used in the view.

You can also specify a query to run:

```html
<RunButton query="users">Run</RunButton>
```

This will run the `users` query when the button is clicked, and it will reactively update the view with the results.

Finally, you can specify an array of queries to run:

```html
<RunButton queries={["users", "transactions"]}>Run</RunButton>
```

This will run the `users` and `transactions` queries when the button is clicked, and it will update the view accordingly.
