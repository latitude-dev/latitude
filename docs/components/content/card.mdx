## Introduction

The `<Card>` component is a flexible and extensible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options.

## Usage

To use the `<Card>` component, simply add the component to your template and pass the content you want to display as children.

There are three main parts to the card component: the header, the body, and the footer. You can use any combination of these parts to create the card you need.

Here's a basic example of a card with a header, body, and footer:

```html
<Card>
  <Card.Header>
    <Text.H3>Card title</Text>
  </Card.Header>
  <Card.Body>
    <Text>Card content</Text>
  </Card.Body>
  <Card.Footer>
    <Text>Card footer</Text>
  </Card.Footer>
</Card>
```
