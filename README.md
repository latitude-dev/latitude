# Latitude

Latitude is an open-source full-stack framework to build interactive data apps
on top of your database or data warehouse using SQL and React/Svelte.

## Documentation

Visit the [public docs](https://latitude-21.mintlify.app/) to view the full documentation.

## Prerequisites

You need to have [NodeJS >18.x](https://nodejs.org/en) installed in your
machine.

## Quick start

Here’s a quick getting started guide to get the sample app up and running:

1. \*\*Install Latitude

Run the following command to install the Latitude CLI globally on your machine:

`npm install -g @latitude-data/cli`

2. **Create the starter project**

Run this command to create a new Latitude project:

`latitude start`

The CLI will ask you the project name. Once you’re done, you’ll have a new
directory with a sample app that you can run and customize.

3. **Navigate to the project and run the app**

`cd my-new-app`

`latitude dev`

This will start the development server and open the sample app in your browser.

## Install

To use the Latitude CLI, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine.
You can download it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en).

Run the following command to install the Latitude CLI globally:

`npm install -g @latitude-data/cli`

### Release

We use [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for doing our
releases. This package has 2 commands very handy.

1. `pnpm changeset add`. It will ask what packages you want to publish and what
   SEMVER version you want to pump. `MAYOR` `MINOR` or `PACTH`. When you pick
   what you want it will write a file with a random file in
   `./changsets/ramdom-name.md`. You can read [more about it here](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/detailed-explanation.md)
2. If you do point (1) you can push the code to GitHub. Nothing will happen. Is
   when you do `pnpm changeset version` that all the files in `.changesets/...`
   are collected, the version on the packages in those files are bumped and a
   release is prepared.
3. Once a release is prepared you can publish with this command: `pnpm publish --recursive --access public`

**NOTE** This release documentation is temporal we need to fully understand the
release cycle. We need to include for example `TAGS` for grouping things. Or
automate the release cycle. Changesets docs are full of great info.
