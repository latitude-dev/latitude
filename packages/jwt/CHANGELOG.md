# @latitude-data/jwt

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 3254d59: - Signed params. Allow users to sign params so they can be send encrypted to latitude server. This is helpful for embedding latitude in a client side application in a iframe
  - Fix bug related with `__force` param not being interpreted correctly because
    it was sent as `$text:true` instead of `true` so query was not recomputed
